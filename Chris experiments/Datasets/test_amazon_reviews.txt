14149	1	4	Y	Sports	B0081Z07NG	Everlast Weighted Power Gloves (Grey, Medium/Large)	Love the Gloves!!	These gloves are very comfy. I use them for zumba and step class. With all the arm movement we do, these gloves add an extra boost to help tone my arms. The size is perfect. I have small hands and it's hard to find gloves that won't fall off. But these are snug as a bug and the Velcro strap is a big help with my small wrists. The weight is distributed evenly so you won't hurt your wrists like those other weights that wrap around your wrists. The only reason I didn't give them a five star is because I couldn't find them heavier than 1 pound. I hope Everlast will make some in 2 or 3 pounds. If they have some I couldn't find them on amazon.
15653	1	1	Y	Pet Products	B0006IK0PQ	Kaytee 12-Inch Giant Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel, Colors Vary	Not as silent as expected,flimsy.	[[VIDEOID:mo50IUXTKLVFPI]]Okay so had this wheel for a couple weeks. Bottom line is its plastic so you hear the spinning whapping sound, the pitter patter of their feet and the most annoying is it wobbles making a banging noise because there's a great deal of space between the cage and the actual wheel. Note that's in the large version. When my girls take off in full gallop the wobbling wheel bangs on the backside of the cage its unbearable. So 4am when i couldn't take it anymore i walked to the kitchen grabbed some pam and sprayed the wheel and realized i attached it upside down initially so that decreased all the noise by like 50% but, i have to say im disappointed by the product and i can sleep with some slight noise. The other members of the house actually was told get up walk over to close my bedroom door at night due to the noise. Then the urine collects in it i have to wipe it down and when it came in the package there was three sharp areas on the outside of the wheel that i had to buff down with a nail filer because im sure my girls could cut themselves. My metal grid wheel lubricated was completely silent to the point that i thought they stopped using the wheel but, they haven't. I got this one because of the danger of owning a mesh wheel. Have to say if it wasn't for their safety i wouldn't order this one. An another note my girls love it. They go nuts over this thing full speed full gallop. I have two rats and only one used to use a wheel now they both go crazy in this thing. I guess 5 stars from rats. Meh three stars for me.<br /><br />Update: Returning it! ugh so bad I'm so upset. Went to wipe it down and the wheel fell right of the wall of the cage! I didn't even put that much pressure worst of all the piece that secure the wheel to the cage was still attached to the cage!! WHAT THE HECK there a mid black plastic clip that clips to the wheel and then snap clips to the other piece that secures the wheel to the cage! I'm sorry but that just makes no sense and totally unsafe. Really whats the purpose of securing the wheel to the cage if it just snaps on to the securing piece with little tiny shallow hook to hole plastic snap mechanism. Which doesn't even hold no matter how hard i click it in. while i tried to attach it to the cage the wheel falls off the clip. I think one of the hooks is bent and doesn't snap tightly anymore. I don't understand if it was for the purpose of faster cleaning but i rather unscrew the cap of to release it and know that its tight and secure when i attach it. Doesn't take that much longer. Jeez One gallop and one of my rats would of flew off the wheel with the wheel along with her! Now it wont snap back on properly so even then i was willing to use the stupid stand nope its tilted and wobbles so much. Why is this thing so unstable?? This wheel is not worth 10$. Included a short video to show what i mean. Don't know if i'm doing something wrong but either way doesnt attach anymore and i'm very disappointed.

12333	1	4	Y	Grocery	B000G6TNOM	Ass Kickin Cashews - Flavor: Habanero - Net Wt: 6oz.	Good taste, not very hot though	Pretty tasty treat, but not very spicy (needless to say, it didn't kick my @$$ at all). It's a tad pricey for a relatively small product. The cashews do taste great in spite of lacking spiciness, but then again I've never tasted a bad cashew in my life!<br /><br />Worth trying out at least once for the sheer novelty.

This is a well made solid rod holder but there needs to be a notice of the maximum rod handle size. cork handle rods 1&#34; or so work well. My foam handled rods which are thicker will not fit at all. I have modified a fish on rod holder to use in my Scotty oar lock mounts  or I would have been out of luck using these rods.

I personally combine it with the app (2$) and have had great results so far. I would suggest lowering the app workout to three days a week and lessening the workout a bit to make up for it, but it's fantastic.

Syncing to our directtv remote was quick and easy. Sounds amazing, noticed an immediate difference between this and another sound bar. Only cons are there is no back light on the remote and unfortunately the small speakers aren't wireless.

14203	1	4	Y	Home Improvement	B000C0158Y	Krylon 2425 12-Ounce  Fusion for Plastic Spray Paint, Satin Burgundy	A good product if you follow these guidelines...	These are great if...<br /><br />You stick with the darker colors.  I thought the Butter Cream would drive me to huff it.  The lighter colors are more powdery while the dark more slick.  The result is easier coverage and both a better appearance and wear.  The lighter shades create a huge cloud of powder which covers you and chips much easier defeating the entire purpose of repainting.  My faves are this Navy and the Burgundy.  Also good were the OSHA Orange and the school bus Yellow.  The White looks very institutional, like nurses shoe's white, and was totally unappealing.  I used these paints to repaint a ton of old plastic garden containers.  The only ones to end up looking like something cheap from Home Depot were the white ones.  We hated them so much on our patio, we donated them to our building to be used elsewhere.<br /><br />Prep the surface!  Just b/c it says you don't have to do too much for prep, go online and learn about prepping plastic for painting.  The ones I prepped more have fared better.  Also, don't expect too much.  If you are reckless with them, they will scratch and chip.  I was careful and am happy.  However, I declined painting the plastic chairs my bldg has on the common patio, something I had planned to do.  I do not think these paints, even the darker colors could withstand the abuse a plastic stacker chair endures.  So, for something somewhat stationary, you shouldn't have issues.<br /><br />You stick to less expensive colors. The prices fluctuate wildly from $12 for a can of White to $2.50 for a can of Burgundy and are constantly changing.  Next month the White could be $3 and the Burgundy, $12.  Some of the colors go far and some = 1.5 - 2 cans to get a 20&#34; planter painted.  Suddenly your cheap dress-up for a plastic planter costs $25.  Add the labor + time and other materials like mask, gloves, drop cloths, it makes more sense to recycle your old ones and buy new.  So try to choose cheaper colors especially at first as your learning to use it for maximum coverage etc.<br /><br />So, I do recommend the product if you are willing to go the necessary distance not to be unhappy with the results.
3587	0	4	N	Automotive	B00065L2D8	Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter Adapter	Pretty nice	I already have a really nice expensive air compressor with cables built in so I wanted this to be a backup if for any reason I ran into issues with my model. I took them out of the package when they arrived to play around with them a bit and they are a bit flimsy and somewhat smaller than what I was expecting, but at this price point I'm not all that surprised. In any case, they're sitting in my trunk now in the case that I need to use them one day. Not bad though, glad I got them!

I should have waited to get a better one which would have lasted longer than the year and a half that this one did. It barely saw any use and yet it just gave up on me.
7661	0	5	Y	Apparel	B00WUI2J6I	Junjiexr Women's Colorful Cotton Twill Snapback Baseball Cap (One Size, Blue coffee)	A quality hat at an excellent price.	The color is good, and I like the fact that it's organic cotton. I have to admit that I don't wear hats often. I always thought they looked funny on me, so I never buy them. I decided to buy this hat to wear on vacation to keep the sun out of my face, and I love it. Not only does it fit great, but it looke great too. I would definitely recommend this hat to others.

The coconut and the milk chocolate is marvellous with together. I usally buy 2 cases of Bounty but it is enough only for 3 weeks. My brother also eat a lot of from this sweets. I could recommend this for everybody who would like some wonderful bites after the dishes. 5 stars!

5593	0	5	N	Grocery	B00L0JLLOE	BOWA Bottled Water System ASTV (At Home Filter & Bottling System) Save Hundreds!	CAN NOT beat the price!	At first, I did experience what a few of the other reviewers mentioned: For $11.99, I thought I was one of those products from china that would soon give up after a couple of days of use. But I decided to try it and hey! It is just the replacement I needed for my water dispenser. It helps me save good amount of $$ which I use to waste on the water bottles plus it has saved me from all the hectic job bring those heavy bottles all the way from the grocery store. The best part is, its filter didn't appear to have any effect on the taste of the water.<br />It's got a nice premium finish to its body, which makes it feel smooth and all glossy. It looks cool lying around the kitchen or in my bedroom. It's easy to put together with a snap. I don't see any reason not to buy this wonderful convenient filter by BOWA, especially in such an amazing price.
13883	1	4	Y	Beauty	B003CTTZQQ	Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8oz, Plastic PET Safe Bottle	The results are great	I've had this for 4 months, and it grew my hair so much. I take 10,000 mcg of biotin daily and that's a big factor in my hair growth too. I mix this oil with coconut oil and rosemary and put it in my hair. I wash it out and it's so soft. My hair is wavy and long so when i'm out the shower  , I put a little bit of this on the ends and it's really soft. I give it four stars because it smells horrible and it's really thick and sticky.

15923	1	1	Y	Books	0425246108	Whispers in the Dark (A KGI Novel)	Psychic conversations. Ugh!	The series was great up to this point.  This book is so ridiculous that I had to skip over most of the psychic conversations. Yes, that's ENTIRE conversations in their heads. Skip it or read it and pretend the conversations are spoken out loud.
2804	0	4	N	Home Entertainment	B00752R4PK	Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player	Works beautifully	We replaced a bad DVD player and this one was so eay to hook up, easy to program and works beautifully. I am not a techy person so when I say easy, its pretty easy. The value spent on it, is worthwhile.
17807	1	5	Y	Automotive	B005VJHO3Q	Genuine GM Parts 15932247 Rear Gate Spoiler	Wake up your duramax tailgate.	Perfect. I love it! I've heard there is some kind of limited edition nascar spoiler out there but I do like this one. Not really a spoiler but way better than the flat piece that was on the truck. Far as I know none of the diesels came with this but mine now has it..
15537	1	5	Y	Furniture	B00EUU5JIY	"Serta RTA Palisades Collection 73"" Sofa in Flagstone Beige, CR43534PB"	Great bang for your buck!	This is fantastic! I live in an upstairs unit and needed help bringing this up (this shipped in a 100 pound box, so I took the box apart and carried the two pieces up separately) but the packaging was very well done. This was so easy to put together and is incredibly comfortable...this is a great &#34;first couch&#34;!
2994	0	1	N	Camera	B0040JHVC2	Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Lens	Watch out!! PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!	I got this camera as a replacement for an older SLR that I had from a few years ago. I wanted something great without going too crazy and spending too much. The first main issue I ran into was the fact that the auto focus system. I then noticed after looking around on the internet that it's a common issue with this model. Only about 1 in 10 pictures were taken correctly due to this focusing issue. I had tried every setting and adjustment but the problem still remained. Also, it would randomly shut off during use for no apparent reason. I just wasn't happy with the camera.<br /><br />I then did some research for a different model that I could be more confident buying so that I would be happy with it's performance during use. Luckily, I did find a way better camera and finally don't have to deal with the annoying issues the 70D had. Nearly every picture I take focuses correctly and stays on during use like it should.<br /><br />If you want a great camera, check out the same one I got here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/WBF8So<br /><br />I hope I was able to help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!

They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

I loved Altair, but Ezio is the best assassin of the series by far. I will have to say this trilogy is the best ASSASSIN'S games but I enjoyed Black Flag much more but it's not really an assassin's game as it is a pirates game. The graphics are a little dated, and ACII and Brotherhood mechanics were lacking up until he gains his hook blade in Revelations. Great games though, definitely worth buying. After you finish Revelations, watch Assassin's Creed Embers to close Ezio's story. I wish they would do more birth-death AC, brings you closer to the character.

When I order a new snorkel I normally have to check the mouth piece and make sure that aren't any sharp edges that need to be filed down, but I never have to do that with Cressi, they are made differently than other brands. This snorkel is very comfortable and doesn't leak when submerged, in addition, it clears very quickly and easily when you come up.

11076	1	2	Y	Camera	B002C1VF54	CowboyStudio Hand Painted 10' X 20' Blue Purple Muslin Photography Background	Sub Par Background Has Many Flaws	I'll caveat this review by saying I'm a fan of CowboyStudio. I use their lighting, backdrop frames and have a few of their muslin backdrops including a green screen all of which are excellent products.<br /><br />This particular backdrop was unfortunately a huge disappointment. I know enough to at least<br />understand that a really good, thick top quality muslin background, be it painted or not can set you back upwards of 300 clams.<br /><br />So I try to keep my expectations reasonable when ordering a background at this price point. However, I feel at any price this particular background will disappoint.<br /><br />* Uneven color and terrible dye bleeds cause shadows<br /><br />* The single most wrinkled background I've ever seen. Expect to spend a good hour steaming them out.<br /><br />* Poor quality stitching, means easy rips and tears<br /><br />* Extremely thin Muslin means a myriad of problems with lighting<br /><br />In my opinion this is a terrible choice, especially for the novice or intermediate, I consider myself in the latter category. That said, if you're looking for a decent background with color, and at this price point  there are plenty to choose from.<br /><br />Cowboy Studio has many fine products however this particular background isn't one of them.

After too much you become numb to it, and might have a fleeting appreciation of the plot structure as a silver lining.<br /><br />The camera work is intimate, and the characters act like a real family. There is true chemistry here, and it isn't obviously plotted like say, the typical Jennifer Aniston movie.<br /><br />And it is because of this intimate bonds that when the lows come, they pack a wallop. I have never seen such wretched emotion in a movie before. I have never seen such natural camaraderie. Incredible.

Whether or not it does, I'm not sure, but it is a nice piece and fit my grandson well; not tight and yet not so loose that it could be a hazard.  I never used anything like this with my children, but then I didn't have a baby who cut teeth nor as many teeth so close together as this little fella has.  He didn't seem to be as fretful while wearing it, but again, I'm not sure if it was the necklace or not.

With this product, it came in a large round jar. Upon opening it the first thing that hit me was the aroma. It has a menthol kind of smell to it that I think is amazing. When applied, it has a cool sensation that feels nice and the gel-cream is neither too thick or too think, it has a perfect consistency that smooths on nicely. I like the way it feels going onto my skin and how quickly it absorbs. I hate getting creams, lotions, make-up, deodorant or anything like that on my clothes when getting dressed. I have been using the body merry line for about a week and a half and this cellulite gel-cream seems to be working well. I am not rid of all my bumps and lumps yet, but they do seem to be fading a little everyday.

19313	1	5	Y	Sports	B001WJ577O	"UTG Shooter's SWAT Bipod, Rubber Feet, Height 6.2""-6.7"""	Nice inexpensive bipod.	UTG Bipod, First off I'm  not a big bipod fan. I find having to adjust the legs to level the scope is just a hassle. I find it easier to sandbag a rifle. I own a Harris bipod for some of my Tactical rifles but rarely use it. I needed an inexpensive option for my 10-22 so I was looking for something cheap. I saw this for 20.00 and said what the hey and free shipping too ! I was stoked when I received this. This is really well made for 20.00. Machining was a little crude but this is expected from Chinese made products. A hole in the threaded nut for the bipod adapter was drilled a bit off center though. This was a quick fix on the drill press. The adapter fit the Ruger well and looks good. It has a black painted finish. The friction leg nuts and release buttons are nicely finished. Good enough for a .22 or a bolt action .223. The bipod is bulky when folded up and is a bit obtrusive. I would not put it on an assault rifle as it would snag on things when on the move. This a GREAT deal for your non extended magazine rifle like a Ruger 10-22 or maybe an SKS.

I anticipated the comming of the dress I would wear for my birthday party next month. It came not only promtly, but EARLY!! I opened the package and tried it on and looked like a sausage link in its plastic casing. Granted I AM plus size (2-3x)but i assumed, and that is my fault, that one size fits all meant... ALL... big mistake. The fabric is a bit itchy/scratchy as some other reviewers stated but not to the point that you would be scratching the whole time wearing it. You can choose to wear the halter strap or not. The print is beautiful, the length is nice about knee/calf depending on hieght. The tube is stretchy, just for regular sizes, not plus. Great buy for reg sizes, plus size go to target its not much different in price, and this should not be listed when you search for plus size dresses.

My cat, (and the ones around the neighborhood that come around for hand outs), have always like Temptations.  This has been a favorite snack of all the cats I have had around here for just about as long as they have been making them. It's always been just a snack for them, given out as a few here and there.  And I have always liked the large variety of flavors.  Although these tumblers are made of pretty much the same ingredients as the regular Temptations, I don't like them as much, and neither I believe do the cats.  Although the idea behind these are for cats to play with their food, I don't think most get it or care, and they would just rather eat them.  Also, like a lot of other reviewers here have pointed out, these really are small balls, maybe twice the size of a BB...I don't think the cats recognize them really as balls to play with, or just don't bother too...Out of the three cats I tested them on, two ate them without playing, and one eyeballed them for a while but eventually ate them.  Perhaps finding the small balls rather unusual...    In conclusion, even if these were actually fun for your cat, I don't personally like the ball shape.  I think all three of the cats I feed prefer the Temptations in their traditional shapes that are much easier for them to chew.  The balls are made pretty small for the cats to find chewable, but its my opinion that most still don't like it...I rate these Temptations 4 stars for taste, with the one star off for the balls that I don't think are that good an idea... : )

My two year old loves Curious George series so this book definitely attracts her.<br />She would sit and go through with me two stories a time, takes more than 20 minutes.<br />That's a long attention span for an active toddler to sit through and focus on.<br />And she asks questions and follows the story line pretty well.<br />I'd say this book isn't that well written for a young child but with a little<br />shortening and simplifying on the wording it works well.<br />The pictures are catching and the stories are interesting.

119	0	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8LL9Q	Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Plus Pack Size 1, 276 Count	Good diaper on the right baby	There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.

I was a little iffy about a mixed product at first, but it holds up really well! The coarseness is just fine enough but not too fine that it's a powder. The quality is strong and sturdy and should hold up for a while to come. I really like this little guy and will be recommending it to friends.

They're easy to get on and off, even with thick socks, and are comfortable to wear for an hour or two at a time while walking my dogs.  I did find that they felt a little constricting (ankle bend) while driving for a couple of hours, but as that is not what they are designed for I can't complain.  A+
8426	0	4	N	Grocery	B001EQ5JLY	PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 80Count Boxes (Pack of 4)	Full Flavored	I consider myself a tea snob. It's suitable when you're an American and you take your tea as seriously as the Englishmen do. This is one of the best and most true-to-advertising English brands I've ever come across. I really look for the boldest of flavors when it comes to my tea and this is one of them. The cup doesn't taste watered down which is so important.<br /><br />I'd be lying if I said there weren't mornings when I really need a pick me up and one bag doesn't do it for me. When I run into those days I add a pinch of pure black tea powder ([[ASIN:B009PIAFTE All Natural Organic Instant Black Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]) and I don't have to waste a whole other bag. The English really know what they're doing so 2 bags will kind of knock you on your behind. It's really affordable to have the powder as an additive.

My dash is probably just shy of being flat, so I've had a bit of trouble with it.  Probably if your dash is totally flat it wouldn't be a problem.  I had to shove a piece of cardboard under the front edge to simulate a flat dash, and it seems okay now.  Did have some trouble with it pulling off before, but not any longer.  Putting the phone in and getting it out is a bit rough on my hands, but it is a great, firm grip!  I'd give it another half star if I could.

In the picture for the item the earings look like a medium sized diamond stud essentially. I was so embarrased by the size of the earings when I got them in the mail that I couldn't even give them to my girlfriend.<br /><br />So I looked like a complete fool because we agreed to a limit to spend on each other and I couldn't give a gift that was about 1/3rd of our limit. The earrings are literally about the proper size for toddler with pierced ears. I deserve a refund as it was a complete scam and was not as pictured or promised.<br /><br />Do not buy from this seller.

The seller claims the pieces are ""solid"" and ""filled"", but no - they're each hollow, flimsy and embarrassing. You can blow them over easier than blowing out a birthday candle! The weight of the pieces is about 14 ounces so each piece must be about 1/4 of an ounce. A shabby production all around, as hollow as the claim that these chessmen are in any way standard. By ""value"" I suppose the this means cheesy. Even the board is nasty and smells funny, but we were able to salvage it after we aired it out for a few weeks. Unfortunately you won't be able to do anything about the cheap hollowed out pieces."
16602	1	3	Y	Grocery	B00B0ZMNOU	Solofill V1 GOLD CUP 24K Plated Refillable Filter Cup for Coffee Pod	Great item with a couple flaws.	I love this item! It's great being able to use my own choice in my Vue machine when I want.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant at first considering a friend of mine had tried similar items for his Platinum Keurig brewer and said the coffee always seemed weak. Thankfully that is not the case here (there is always the strong option on the Vue brewer if you need it even stronger).<br /><br />As of writing this review I believe this is the only product out there that fulfills this function for the Vue brewer. Luckily this item is quality built and designed very well. Their customer service responds quickly and was very helpful regarding my inquiries. The piano hinge is very strong and the plastic the cup is made of is thick, so I believe it will last a long time. The cup and filter are easy to clean, although at a while the file does start to darken with coffee oils, although they informed me that this can be easily taken care of with distilled white vinegar and a soft toothbrush. The decaflow head does distribute water evenly. This item also works well with loose leaf tea and I have used tea bags with great success as well.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that you must make sure the lid is compressed as possible, and must be careful when closing and opening the Vue machine. The cup can and will slide, which if not careful when will damage the needle due to the cup sliding out into the needles path. I'm not sure if they could have designed a solution to this problem due the design of the machine's horizontal brewing style.<br /><br />UPDATE July 9th, 2013: After attempting to clean off some of the coffee that stains/builds up on the gold screen after a while following the instructions I received after making an inquiry (see review above) some of the gold plating has come off. I was extremely gentle with the soft toothbrush after letting it soak in distilled white vinegar overnight. I even tried using the pads of my fingers very lightly which yielded in the sameresult unfortunately.<br /><br />I still believe this product is worth purchasing if you want to use your own coffee with the Vue machine as it fulfills its function very well....Just be aware of the couple downsides with this product as well.

After searching for a Cole Hann shoe that would fit with ease I am very dissatisfied as the sole has cracked with less then 6 months of wear time.  I used these shoes in a rotation with three others and did not expect them to wear out as fast as they did.  I could see if worn daily that some issues would arise but this was unexpected and am very dissatisfied.
10899	1	5	N	Grocery	B00DBSG80O	Cheez-It Cracker Cup, White Cheddar, 2.2 Ounce (Pack of 10)	Cup container is handy for snacking while driving	These Cheez-It cups are very handy when you want a snack while driving. I find it's easier to reach into the cup and grab a few crackers than into a bag, while trying to keep my eyes on the road. The Cheez-It cup fits into my car's large cup holder, so it's within easy reach and I don't spill them everywhere. The white chedar crackers are milder than the original cheese flavor, but still taste just as great.<br /><br />I like the size and find these are a great teen/adult size snack. We have all kinds of snack packs in our pantry, since I buy for my kids school lunches. They're all quite small. They are usually even smaller than you would get out of a vending machine. I like the larger size of these cups, since generally when I want a snack, it's because I'm really hungry and didn't have time to eat anything. I'd rather just take one 2 oz cup like this with me than 2 or 3 little tiny kid's lunch baggies. I like the size. Perfect for when you're on the go.

15308	1	3	Y	Shoes	B001KU6U94	Stacy Adams Men's Templin Bicycle-Toe Slip-On,Black,12 M	Kind of look like clown shoes	Maybe it's just that I have a larger than &#34;normal&#34; foot, at size 12 (Per the sizing chart), but when I opened the box, I couldn't help but think of a clown, as these shoes extend almost 6 inches beyond a normal size 12, but when trying them on, they were very tight.  I've worn them now once a week for several weeks and they are getting easier to slip on and nobody aside from my wife has said anything about the clown look.  Maybe that's the fashion these days...................

"I just recently ordered these about a week ago and just received them in the mail.  THESE ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE IN THE DESCRIPTION.  They are flimsy and instead of being chrome, it is like a duct tape silver color.  It looks a bit 3D in the picture , but mines are flat and looks like something i can buy at Wal-Mart.  Also the description says 3M tape on the back, that is false as well.  I am so dissatisfied that I called them with the card they sent me to attempt to ask them if they were aware of problem that it doesn't match the description online ... the response I received from the lady that spoke to me was .. ""SO DO YOU WANT A REFUND?"" .. this makes me more upset because there was no proper answer given or customer service given to me besides telling me to ship it back but its going to cost me about the same to ship it back for a measly 12 dollars i spent.  Instead of shipping it back and getting that money back, I rather type up this review and be more satisfied that no one else makes anymore purchases from these guys because I am damn sure there items does not match item descriptions.  So PLEASE BEWARE AND BE CAREFUL, don't waste your hard earned money on cheats like this.  Honestly those positive comments seem to good to be true, even though i was betting on them to be real, but this is the internet and those comments might be from this company making alias creating those positive comments themselves.  If I am able to take time out of my life to type this out, I appreciate anyone that read these before they buy, because of genuine people like me take pride in where my money is spent."

All set at FULL HOT. The only one that didn't get as hot was the one furthest away from the water heater. I would recommend this unit to any one. I also freed up space in my utility room. This unit sits on the wall and I can now add shelving where the tank used to be.

Be advised. . . since it is old school it has a trackball and uses the old ps/2 mouse connection.  As a collector's item, it's GREAT.  As a gaming mouse, it doesn't measure up to what's out there now.  I also remember a C3PO and a Vader mouse that was available from the same manufacturer at the time(1998).  Lot's of great memories playing Starcraft over a LAN with the Storm Trooper mouse receiving copious amounts of nerd envy.

The wooden pegs do poke out. they were not sanded down at all and it gives the bamboo a rough feeling. One of the pegs was also missing when I opened the packaging which allowed some of the material to slip out of the rainstick.. I had a bamboo skewer stick that fit into the hole snugly. There was also a pretty big indentation in the middle of the rainstick. At first I thought it was damaged in shipping but upon closer inspection it seems to be where they filled it from and set some sort of plug there.  The sound from this rainstick is okay. when tipped slowly it sounds good, but any more than a moderate cascade and it does sound &#34;off&#34;. For the money I can't complain as its intended for light use.

8303	0	5	N	Home Improvement	B00JOBJUI4	Frostfire Winter 16 Bright LED Wireless Solar Powered Motion Sensor Light (Weatherproof, no batteries required)	Great garden light	If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! Once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.

12113	1	1	N	Video Games	B007FTE2VW	SimCity: Limited Edition	Simcity 5....Demo....	First off i got to actually play the game for 3 hours straight no problem. Which was the opening day.... for the past couple days i have unsuccessfully not connected to the servers. So i paid $80 for a demo. (i got the digital deluxe edition.) Of what i DID play its awesome....accept that you have to play with other players, NOT TRUE....you can make a private game. Or INVITE ONLY game. The problem with the online server is that only ONE of the dam areas that you can build your city works and you can only build your city on one plot of land. As far as game looks and gameplay, it's excellent. I liked how easy the menus were and its close to the other simcity gameplay. A lot of new things to go along with it too. I HATE that it does not have offline mode, i a member of the armed forces and what i do in my offtime is workout and game, and i love this game and i really dislike that i cannot play it while out to sea or deployed to places that don't have internet. (which is in May) As you all know the servers are not working...So what do you get when you have an Online game that runs on online servers that dont work? a game that doesn't work, and ultimately thats how this review is going to go for this. I paid $80 for 3 hours of working gameplay. Thank you EA and Maxim for delivering so far.. I will update and rate based on the game working....when it is actually working...but until then...1 star.

I wanted a portable speaker for my iPad/iPhone that I could recharge via USB, not have to use batteries. Much better sound quality than I expected.  I'm glad I found this one before buying a &#34;high end&#34; version at Sams, Best Buy, etc. for $100-$300. I imagine they have better sound, but I don't need that.

The story sent chills down my spine. The Pakistan army's horrific massacre of the Bengalis  and the killing of Urdu-speaking people by the Bengalis need to be looked at together. While the atrocities by the Pakistan army has been told and re-told this is the first well written account of both sides of the story. No one wins when innocent blood is shed. The novel is one that should be read by all those who abhor war and violent political conflict.

I'm always the skeptic when it comes to these âget a workout fastâ kind of things, but this time, I was shocked. I've tried my fair share of get ripped quick devices, mostly for entertainment, but this one is by far the one that actually does something.

It's connectors were meant for multi-strand wire found inside fans and fixtures. It does not work well with single strand house wiring. It's short whip antenna is a neat feature.

18507	1	2	N	Books	0802123015	Northanger Abbey	Written for and about a teenager.....	This book was beyond predictable and although it is based on a Jane Austen novel, it completely lacks that author's use of language and phrase to make a thin story become a pleasure to read.  I doubt that even your 'average' teenager, or pre-teen for that matter, would find this 'a good read', so it certainly is not for an adult reader.  It was simply fluff.  The only redeeming feature was the descriptions of the Edinburgh festival.  And that is not enough to hang your hat on.....  Don't bother.

I love the glasses Joan wears and when I saw the &#34;oversized&#34; offer I thought just what I want. Not. I have the &#34;regular&#34; Joan glasses and the oversize were not as big as I would have liked. I can go spin the sun glass carousel at my upscale clothing store and find bigger. I will keep them because I like the style.

16231	1	3	Y	Home Improvement	B000DZCYLA	COX 41001 Wexford 10.3-Ounce Cartridge Manual Skeleton Steel Caulk Gun	It only last as long as the others	This caulk gun only last as long as any other gun I have purchased in the last year. I use my caulk gun every day, At least 2 - 3 tubes of silicones and 2 tubes of addhesive each day.<br /><br />Pro's: The gun does not allow the ram to push at a slant like may guns which causes the tubes to split or squish out the bottom. The release works very well and releaves all pressure on tube so no mess out the end. It continued to kind of work after it broke sa I could finish my work.<br /><br />Con's: Just as the title reads it only last a about 2 months. Due to my heavy daily use the gun started showing signs of where near the top bar brace near the release. It broke in that spot where the wear was starting.<br /><br />I will not purchase this gun again. I would have like to see it totally wear out from use then it would be worth buying again but not brake.<br /><br />If you only caulk once twice a year this gun may last forever and would be worth the purchase but not for everyday use.

5234	0	5	Y	Apparel	B009N2AL00	FLATSEVEN Mens Slim Casual Waffle Fabric Blazer Jacket (BJ105) Gray, US M/Asia XL	Well fitted	You know for men blazer is always a cool formal dress. I like this for the color combination, I brought a gray one which color I prefer most as blazer and shirt. They display this blazer as a jacket but I think It is more blazer then jacket and I loved that so much. People can use that as blazer and jacket both.<br /><br />There are 4 button and flip pockets for this one in a good fitting for cleaning this one you can only use dry clean though. As the price consideration this one is so cool for me.

I bought this to get an extension for my air-mattress pump so I did not have to put my car too close to the tent when camping, first time I use is, when pulling it out of the socket it disassembled and got stuck on the 12V socket of my car. Tried screwing in the plug cover but thread will constantly slip out when pulled. Had to cut the cable and use pliers to remove the remaining part of the plug from my 12V socket.<br /><br />Pros: Amazing grade cable<br /><br />Cons: Poor workmanship on the plug end. Cheap plastic contact plug.<br />  1 time use only.

I won't repeat the accolades from other reviewers, but I do want to point out that the Battle Mode, contrary to popular opinion, is an excellent feature and works great. It is not lazy by any means. Using real tracks is a subtle way to allow for exploration and more strategy. The U turn mechanic is amazing and hectic. Online battle plays well. Perfect game. Now bring on the DLC !!

2287	0	3	N	Books	1432799320	Life Lessons from Nature: Motivational Speaker, Military Strategist, Political Advisor, Scientist & Engineer, Foster Parent	Good... but it could be better !!!	I never think that we can gain much knowledge from Nature until I read this book. There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me.

12746	1	5	N	Video DVD	B0068RHSZO	Dream House (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)	Gripping...	A fantastic psychological thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock, which grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go until it's shocking conclusion. The notion that something is not quite right lingers throughout the film, but you can't put your finger on exactly what it is. Wonderful performances by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz as husband and wife who move to the suburbs in search of a peaceful place to raise their daughters and Naomi Watts as their neighbour. The viewer's realities are shattered more than once forcing a shift in perception to understand what you are seeing and what is truly going on.<br /><br />Chris Alderson<br />Author of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide
11708	1	4	N	Baby	B0057ECYS0	Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer	Does what it should	This is a very good unit for the price and what it does. I got it for my niece for a present since she was expecting. She uses it all the time and says it does a great job at sterilizing the bottles, nipples, pacifiers, etc.<br /><br />A lot of people might not have a use for this however. Everyone seems to be into disposable this, and 'one use' that. No one wants to take a few minutes to wash something and reuse it, when they can just buy disposable stuff and toss it when done. It's a shame because they are making more of a hardship on their children in the near future since a lot of that plastic and 'disposable' stuff will take up a lot of landfill space, and be around for a long, long time.<br /><br />My niece says the different size configurations are nice, it doesn't take up much room, and saves her money on the bottle liners that other people buy and toss. It doesn't take long to do it's job, and you can be sure it's clean, because you did it yourself.

10565	1	3	N	Video DVD	B00C1LIYWM	Safe Haven	Nicholas Sparks Romance with Just a Little Bit of Mystery	Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />âSafe Havenâ is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse HallstrÃ¶m (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance âDear Johnâ a few years ago), âSafe Havenâ is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For âSafe Havenâ attempts to be a âmysteryâ â in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katieâs neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.

This was a delightful meal for our little 12 year old mini-pin, who unfortunately has lost most of her teeth.  It's was moist enough to take the way it is.  The packaging is conveniently resealable. She had this one tub for two meals. It does seems a little bit costly for dog food, but if you can fit it in your budget, it is a good one.

I can go into a long review but I don't see the need, you get what you pay for. This razor feels cheap. The heads are not very flexible and the groomer is not very sturdy.  It's a pain to clean and it cannot get wet. I have bought many electric razors and I can tell you that this will get the job done but like I said before, get a better one if you can afford it.

It does not press against my eyelids and is therefore, very comfortable as I fall asleep. The contoured shape does have to be in just the right position to ensure no light comes in, but that doesn't bother me. I like the idea of the velcro straps, but sometimes my hair gets a little caught in them. Again, that doesn't bother me. I only use these on long flights, and occasionally on the weekends, so that I am not awakened by the sun on days that I can sleep in. I would definitely recommend these.

This is my first purchase of &#34;crystal balloons&#34; so maybe I am expecting too much (aka THE IMPOSSIBLE), but I was surprised to see them go from crystal to solid within a few hours. Had I not taken pictures as soon I was done inflating them, I would not have believed they were ever crystal to start with.<br />That being my disappointment, I was otherwise satisfied with the quality and color assortment. Although I should mention that due to the amount of colors included, the amount of each individual color was random: I counted 29 red, 21 orange, 18 green. (There were other colors as well-blue, yellow, crystal clear). So if you intend to make colorful &#34;patterns&#34; this might not be the best buy for you.

My old Timex gave out.

12914	1	5	N	Baby	B00AHPZZGC	Chicco Keyfit 30 Infant Car Seat and Base, Sedona	Pros and Cons	I am very familiar with this seat as I babysit my nephew daily and he has this exact model.  I only have a couple complaints about the seat and they're not major issues.  Now that I am pregnant, I will likely buy the same seat for my own child.  P.S. my nephew is now in the chicco next fit and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />Pros-<br />Operation..all around.  The way it latches and unlatches from the base is easy.  The way the belts tighten and loosen to fit baby is great.  The operation of the handle is also much easier to fold back than some I have seen.<br /><br />Installation was so easy.<br /><br />The material feels durable without being stiff.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The canopy doesn't cover much at all.<br />The seat is quite heavy, but most are heavier than they should be in my opinion.<br />The seat (when in the base) takes up quite a bit of space in my car (2013 Acura RDX).  It wouldn't fit behind the driver as the next fit now will.

5205	0	5	N	Beauty	B00BPBLMCS	baKblades Big Mouth Do-It-Yourself Back Hair Shaver	A Must Get Shaver	"After using this back shaver for some time now I decided to give a great demonstration on how the shaver works.  The baKblade is definitely set apart from the other back shavers for multiple reason.  First, the baKblade has a larger blade that covers so much ground when shaving you are literally done in less than a minute.  The shave actually feels great and because of the way the shaving blades are arranged it's impossible to cut your back when using the shaver.  Also, there is no need for shaving cream when dry shaving as you can see from the video the shaver doesn't take much effort to actually get the job done either.  I have recommended this shaver to many friends and family and no one has every had a negative thing to say about it.  Also, the handle is very lightweight and has an ergonomic curve to it that allows the user to reach the ""hard to reach"" areas.  Another feature of this shaver that is a huge benefit is the fact that it actually tackles longer hairs too so if you are shaving your back for the first time there's no need to use a hair trimmer or electric trimmer to trim away first.  The blade surprisingly works under any circumstance. Take a look at my video and please vote ""yes"" if you feel this video was helpful to you."

I went ahead and ordered it.  It took a little longer than usual for it to arrive but well worth the wait.  I opened the package, took out the band and read the instructions.  I proceeded to assemble the watch band to my iPod.  The screws were small so I assembled on a microfiber towel since the screws would not bounce off my desk.  Everything assembled correct.<br />  I found no issue with this band.  Wearing the ipod adds style to you and your wrist.  People asked me what I was wearing and when I showed and told them about it, they were amused and amazed.  I showed them the watch function and the other icons and even put my earphones on to listen.  They wanted one as well.<br />  I highlt recommend this watch band for your Ipod.  Well worth the money since the machined aluminum parts are well made.

This is an amazing mattress for the price, you just can't beat it.  I was tempted to spend much more on a memory foam mattress, but glad I saved my money on this instead.  Very easy to assemble and when you see the box it comes in, its hard to believe theres a mattress set in it.

8333	0	5	N	Home Improvement	B00K5JR9R8	Uritc Portable Multi-functional LED Lighting with Built-in Battery for Running Fishing Camping Hiking Tent Emergency	nice	This is an exceptional little light. I like that it has four settings, has a rechargeable battery, and is very east to carry around or hang in a closet. I have mine hanging in a hall closet that doesn't get much light from the hallway light, and this thing lights it up very well. The highest regular setting is more than adequate to provide very bright light where needed. The lower setting also give out a good amount of light for smaller areas.<br /><br />This will be a great light to have when power goes out, or for times you just need more light for projects around the house. I am very pleased with this purchase and plan to get a few more to have on hand for when there are power outages. Definitely recommend this!

The best part is seeing the smile on his face when he flies it. It seems to give him a sense of power and self-confidence. He feels in control of a situation,which he doesn't always. I bought this for him to play with, but we've gotten so much more from this 'copter than we ever could have imagined! My wife and I are thrilled!

12358	1	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B0002IXKP2	Natural Chemistry 3121 Pool Perfect Concentrate Pool Water Cleaner, 3-Liter	This product really works, Poolman video review	"[[VIDEOID:mo37UNPUFCV43W7]]This product really works as described. It has some kind of powerful enzyme that breaks down scum in the pool water.<br /><br />At this account I would scrub these tiles every week and the scum would just come right back as if I never scrubbed the tile line. The customer would constantly complain.<br /><br />I thought I would give ""Pool Perfect"" by Natural Chemistry a shot here as I have used it successfully on less extreme cases. Basically the problem here is that the dogs will swim in this pool every week and the gardener will blow dust and junk into the pool each week with his leaf blower. It really doesn't help that these tiles are light tan in color.<br /><br />So I scrubbed the tiles once again and then I added the ""Pool Perfect."" To be honest I didn't have high expectations at this account. The next week I was surprised to see the tile looking like I just cleaned them. I added two more capfuls of ""Pool Perfect"" and gave it another week. As you can see from the video after three weeks the tile is still looking like I just cleaned them (As of now it has been 5 weeks and the tile still looks great).  So I have been adding the maintenance dose each week now and  haven't had to scrub the tile line. This stuff works amazingly well.<br /><br />If you are interested in the tile brush (it actually attaches to a pole nicely but in this pool the decking overhangs at an angle so it is easier to use it by hand) Here is the make:<br />Purity Pool TSQC Tile Scrubber with Quick Connect<br /><br />It comes with a regular pad but I upgrade to a more coarse one:<br />Purity Pool RPC Replacement Pad for Tile Scrubber, Coarse"

13036	1	4	N	Books	1570759219	All Is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day	Ordinary Grace	This is a fine biography, revised (as others have mentioned) and graced with pictures and Forest's own reminiscences.  It is very well written, and covers the whole breadth of her amazing life.  It is very fair: it doesn't whitewash Day's crankiness or stubbornness or (to an outsider) her willful adherence to a Church that bears no relationship to anything Jesus would have had any part of, on any reasonable reckoning. The community of spirits and the communion of souls are more present in the Catholic Worker's activities in the soup kitchens than in all the popery and bishoprics.  Still, if it was good enough for St. Francis, then it seems to have been good enough for Dorothy Day.  Whether it is worthy of them is a deeper question.<br /><br />Whole sections of the book resonate with the dire situation of the American poor today in the New Depression; and also remind us of the vast political struggle that went on then to wrestle even some kind of mercy from the capitalist machine.  It reminds us of how much people suffered to bring about the basic safety net that ideologues are working day and night to dismantle in favour of the mercilessness of the harsh Gods of the Blessed Free Market.  And how much of that suffering is now, and will likely have to be suffered all over again.<br /><br />The book also reminds us of the stultifying world in which Day operated, and the dreariness of much of it: the drab buildings, the endless dishwashing and sweeping, the narrow mindedness.  It also reminds us of how early Day and her colleagues were in so many protests: anti-nuclearism, race and Vietnam being only a few of them.  It would be a good book to give to contemporary activitists:  perhaps the strongest message in the book is the need for order and discipline throughout both the dreariness and the wildness; and the essential role of daily prayer (of whatever kind) to keep one going in the midst of the burdens of chaos and failure on many levels.

I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret buying it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming very quickly as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. I tried to deal with it for as long as I could but then decided this wasn't what I paid for.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy!

They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace). The problem was these earrings were so flimsy that they started to bend upon opening the lever-back. Not good. I was afraid I might rip my earring hole trying to get these off. If they weren't so malleable, they would be awesome.

11593	1	4	Y	Books	0785192336	X-Men Volume 4: Exogenous (Marvel Now)	Space Adventure for the X-Men	Collecting: X-Men (2013) #18-22<br /><br />In the previous adventure, [[ASIN:0785189726 X-Men Volume 3: Bloodline]], the all-female X-Men's adventure was rooted firmly on planet earth.  In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.<br /><br />The Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.<br /><br />These issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.<br /><br />If you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.  The next adventure for this X-team can be found in [[ASIN:0785197265 X-Men Vol. 5: The Burning World]]

The wine stays in great condition and we've never had any problems with the wine later, unlike many of the fancy or pretty stoppers we've had and purchased in the past.  The colors are cheerful and make them easy to locate in your kitchen. I highly recommend these stoppers.

18579	1	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B008WTO8KY	WARRIOR SUPREME,MOSQUITO BUG ZAPPER,HIGHEST POWER OF ANY RACKET 4000V MADE,FAST	Works on Cluster Flies but get the C cell model	Works on Cluster Flies! The first &#34;Tennis racket of Death&#34; that was sent to me was defective. It happens. The company then sent a replacement but it was an AA model and not the one I ordered which was the C cell. I bought an older farmhouse and needed this for the bugs that are there. Which at this time of year consist of Cluster Flies and Asian Lady Beetles. The AA model took like 6 hits to kill a cluster fly. Sometimes they would drop on the ground and get up fairly quickly. Asian Lady Beetle which sort of look like a ladybug but aren't, tnded to die after being zapped a couple of times.<br />Once the C cell model arrived Cluster flies would die in 1-2 zaps and ALB's would die with one hit. If you've never dealt with either of these pests they are super annoying and can get into the tiniest of spaces. Cluster flies will ply dead by laying on their backs and hide in cracks so tiny you can't figure out how they fit. Lady beetles are worse. When the light and heat comes on these bugs come out in force and both will bite. I fully expected these bugs to explode like popcorn but they are super tough as well as clever. They will walk rather than fly. No idea how this will work on wasps or hornets but will find out in the spring.<br />If you want something that kills quick you really need the bigger model. For stuff like spiders and mosquitos the AA model should work well. For hardier insects get the C cell model you will need it.<br />also be very careful if you go after web spiders. The webs can make contact with the electrical contacts and it will pop and zap as if it were a bug on it. The product works well and as advertised but some bugs are tougher to kill than others and you really shouldn't kill Asian lady beetles with this because they stink pretty bad when they pop from being zapped. I accidentally killed a stink bug with this and whoo wee! did it ever smell. Lady beetles aren't as bad but they do reek when they die.

13906	1	4	Y	Sports	B001A4QVVW	Uncle Mikeâs Reinforced Instructorâs Belt (Medium, Black)	Nice belt	I did like this belt for the most part. Very stiff for carrying a sidearm IWB. I personally did not like the buckle design, it is on the large side and pointed which tended to catch on things even though i would have a shirt hanging over it. Also not a big fan of the noise of the velcro sound when releasing the belt. I wore this belt everyday for a month then returned it and purchased another belt. Amazon credited me the full purchase price and shipment and delivery were great!

5790	0	5	N	Books	0991564820	The EB-5 Handbook: A Guide for Investors and Developers	Honestly helpful. Easy to digest.	Great book, I have the hard copy and kindle version. It was an absolutely informative read as I have been interested in immersing myself into more EB-5 information. It honestly has given me a more high-level, high-ground perspective on the entire industry (especially the investors and developers). I love the step-by-step guide in both the distinctly separated investors and developers section. I thought that was very helpful in separating the roles of the two bigger players in the industry.<br /><br />There is just too much information about EB-5 floating around, specifically biased articles from the media. This book was able to give me a clear-headed idea of exactly how I should approach the people within the industry and how to explain it to those who are interested in entering the industry. EB-5 is definitely a complex industry and it's not something that is easy to just dive into. I believe the book was a great starting point for myself.

"Check printers are no longer including multiple checkbook registers with each box of checks you purchase.  Instead, you receive one register with every two boxes - but, you can purchase additional registers for between $2.50 and $3, plus shipping.  Thus, the total cost per register is outrageous and, for individuals who still track spending manually, unacceptable.  Amazon, once again, has proven to be a source for a necessary, but hard-to-finde product.<br /><br />Each of these ""Checkbook Transaction Registers"" has 23 two-sided pages with 16 lines per page.  Assuming you use each line on a page to record your transactions there is space for 736 items; if you alternate, leaving a blank line or use the shaded line for a memorandum, you have half the space.<br /><br />The ""Checkbook Transaction Registers"" are constructed of good quality paper which is not flimsy.  Highlighting does not bleed through unless one has a heavy hand with the marker.<br /><br />If you record your spending, whether by check or credit/debit card, on a register, you will be pleased with this product being sold on Amazon."

11780	1	5	N	Books	1559724749	Jerry Seinfeld:  The Entire Domain	A Complete Story	"Jerry Seinfeld, Tracy<br /><br />Kathleen Tracy is an entertainment journalist who wrote other biographies. This 1998 book was written after the series ended. Jerry Seinfeld chose to end the series after nine years, it wasn't due to falling ratings. [The book says there was criticism about the stories.] This book covers Jerry's life from childhood to a national television star in 19 chapters. It has an `Episode Guide' to the 179 episodes and an `Index'. It tells about the stand-up comedians and the business of comedy in the 1980s. The show ran from May 1990 to May 1998. Was it ""a show about nothing"" as some said? It portrayed (or mocked) the lives of the personal servants of the rich and their problems. Did many of its audience identify with these characters and their problems? Did they know people like them? Or was it because it dealt with topics censored from the usual TV comedies? [I was not a fan and seldom watched the shows.]<br /><br />One example of its influence is on page 133 where an executive employee was fired for discussing an episode. A wrongful termination lawsuit awarded him $26 million. Euphemisms may work in a controlled TV show but have unwanted effects in the real world. Was this double-entendrÃ© part of the appeal of the show? Episodes dealt with the events of everyday life but looked at them from a humorous viewpoint. Can parking in a handicap-only spot generate humor? Its not funny to a handicapped person who needs that spot! Dealing with topics not usually discussed is certainly daring. It also dealt with ordinary problems, life finding your car in a huge parking garage. [Write down the location on a piece of paper.] It warned about the need to safeguard your financial records (""The Truth""). [Use a copying machine.]<br /><br />Jerry was born in 1954 and spent a lot of time watching TV (Chapter 1). [That TV station in NYC (p.3) now shows reruns of ""Seinfeld"" at night after prime time.] He graduated from Queens College in 1976 with a double major in theater and communication arts; then started as a stand-up comic (Chapter 2). The 1980s saw hundreds of comedy clubs started (Chapter 3). [There is a lot of details about the comedy business here.] Jerry appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1981. His career grew (Chapter 4). He was a clean comic. Jerry could earn as much as ""the mid-five figures per week"" (p.48). Jerry built up a car collection (p.51). [Some inner hunger?] Jerry got together with Larry David to work on an NBC show about conversation (Chapter 5). Characters were based on people they knew. NBC ordered four more shows (p.63). Jerry's job as performer, producer, and writer was a heavy workload. The remaining fifteen chapters continue the story of this successful comedy show. Chapter 14 tells Jerry's idea of a perfect girlfriend. Read Chapter 15 for more details.<br /><br />Can this show ever be copied? For what reason? Shows are aimed at the 18 to 49 year olds because they have the most disposable income and spend their money more freely (p.111). Would you like these characters as neighbors or friends or co-workers? Too self-absorbed? What has changed after 15 years? Chapter 18 explains the economics of show business regarding salaries ad advertising. What does this say about the audience for TV shows?"
17466	1	5	Y	Office Products	B00HNCNT0G	Chalk Ink Markers - NEON Set (8-pack), BEST Chalk Ink Pens for Dry Erase Boards, Blackboards, Whiteboards, Mirrors, Car Windows & Decorating in Colors	Great marker	First, let me warn you about the instructions of the markers. When I got them I was so excited that I opened the package without hesitation. I used one and nothing happened, no ink, no nothing; and I thought &#34;they don't work!&#34; and then, I had an aha moment when I saw the instructions on the marker! The steps are so easy to follow that even my 3 year old daughter was helping me with the first two. So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink.<br /><br />I like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don't squeak.<br /><br />The markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected!<br />The color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don't have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror. She couldn't believe me when I told her to do that (because that doesn't happen around here), she ran as fast as she could before I change my mind!<br /><br />I can use them on my Pyrex to make sure someone won't take it by mistake at gatherings, or for my &#34;to do list&#34; just in case I loose the paper version, or my daughter might think daddy's car needs some color! So many things.....<br />The only color I wish they have is purple, my daughter's favorite color! We ended up using red and blue and voila, purple!<br />But over all, I LOVE them!<br /><br />I should say to use caution when replacing the cap as it can catch on the marker top and mash it. My daughter did that to a couple of them.

If only it played nice with android devices...Well first off I was very excited to get this item. However, although my Android device is Bluetooth 4.0 smart capable (LE) the device does not have an android app that functions with it currently. There is a large amount of finger pointing occurring with regards to Wahoo stating that Google has not opened up the Bluetooth API. So long story short if you have an android device this will not function. You will be able to see the device in the bluetooth settings but you will not find any apps that can leverage it.<br /><br />That being said I did test the device with my spouse's iPod touch and it works well if you have an apple device. There are multiple apps that support this device so you are not limited to wahoo's app (open is the way to go!).<br /><br />If you own an iphone or ipod touch (last two generations) you can leverage this very nice cadence sensor. The device was simple to mount to the frame and was complete within minutes. If you want a step by step guide one is available at Wahoo's site. For the rest stay away... until they can get an app that functions with android, wp8.

20851	1	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00CCYZ13S	VIZIO M501d-A2R 50-Inch 1080p 3D Smart LED  HDTV (2013 Model)	WOW	"Purchased this to replace an aging 42 inch Panasonic Plasma.  The Plasma has been great but this new Vizio is absolutely amazing.  The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I've owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a ""pop"" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.<br /><br />The second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.<br /><br />I did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.  We shall see."

Perhaps this is best suited for laptops up to 15.6"".<br /><br />Update 9/10/12: Because I have not been able to find what I believe to be a suitable laptop table for 17.3 laptops, I will be sticking with this one because I got tired of looking and don't have the time. I will, however, be modifying this table by inserting some kind of plastic rod/piece the size of a ruler between the legs on each side of the table in the hopes of stiffening it when I type. I wanted to add to my review, as well, that I really enjoy the fan (seems to be quiet) and the led light."
16548	1	5	N	Furniture	B00QMNYG7C	Stony-Edge No Assembly Folding Bookcase, 4 Shelves, Media Cabinet Storage Unit, for Home & Office, Quality Furniture. Espresso Color. 16â Wide.	Great shelf for a great price	Let me start by saying how pleased I am with the promptness of delivery from them. I am a Prime Member so I know that helps. I love how I get a witty email from the company informing me that my item as shipped (not just the dry notification from Amazon itself).  But let's talk about the product.  I absolutely love the dark colour. It adds a touch of quality to my teenage son's bedroom. Assembly really was a breeze. In fact I purposefully took a hands off approach to see if it was as easy as the ad claimed. I let my 15 year old open and set up alone. Granted the first thing he did was yell down the stairs that it would take a while as he needed tools. I asked him if he was sure (you know boys don't always read directions). Less than thirty seconds I heard a chagrined no. He had it up and ready to use in less than three minutes. He came bounding downstairs with the empty box and a packet of screws that he didn't know what they were for. I asked him to give them to me and the directions so that I could investigate as clearly he still was refusing to read anything. Males, you have to love them.  I went upstairs to investigate the product. It is nice and sturdy no loose wobbling when I shake it. I hate furniture that feels like it is going to fall apart if you bump it too hard, and with a teenager I guarantee this will get bumped. It clearly will stand up to him. Not that it was dusty or anything but I figured I should test how well it would stand up to my cleaning products. I grabbed my can of Pledge, hosed it down. No ill effects at all.  Also the company included wall brackets in case you wanted to anchor it to the wall. At first I thought, &#34;Who actually does that with a bookshelf?&#34; Turns out the company is flat out brilliant for including them. I'll get back to why in a moment. Let me explain how the bookshelf is working out for us.  We live in a townhouse where space is an issue and cannot fit traditional dressers so we have to be creative on how we store clothes. We had been using the plastic drawers that you can get at stores like Wal-Mart. Those work well but they just make the place look so juvenile. With the colour of the wood I feel like I'm not living in a college dorm. My son is able to place his clothes here and his mother is very very happy (he was just shoving them in the drawers willy nilly. We actually like it so well that we will be ordering a second one for him to use to place his school books and X-box items.  Back to why the wall brackets are just brilliant. My teenager shares his room with a 2 year old. Of course the first thing that crumb snatcher did was grab the shelf and start moving it (it is a very light weighted piece of furniture). He of course tried to use it as his own personal ladder. The light bulb went off, the brackets. I don't know if the shelf would tip over if we had it weighed down with books (like a lot of folks would actually use a bookshelf for) but that actually could be even worse for my little one to have fall on him. At least when it came down with him all he really did was make a mess (might I add the shelf was undamaged even after the rugrat climbed on top of it like he was conquering Mt. Everest). We just attached the wall brackets and now it is nice and secure. I personally wouldn't have used the brackets if I didn't have that little bundle of energy, it isn't necessary for balance but if you have a small child it's a nice safety precaution. And now my teenager also thinks it's a backpack hook as well. He &#34;hangs&#34; his 40 lb plus school backpack from the top corner. It stays firmly in place.  I attached two photos that my son took once he 'put it together' mainly because let's face it their photo is professionally taken. I wanted y'all to be able to see the colour when an amateur takes the photo. I'd say it's the spitting image of the photo posted with the ad. I don't know why it rotated the photos to the side.  So yes, all in all I am very pleased with my purchase.

13911	1	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B0076KYIBY	Super Daily D3 Baby Liquid Carlson Laboratories 10.3 ml Liquid	Great	Way better than any other brand especially the one by Rugby which is the worst of all!!<br />This one is really easy and quick to use while contains the same daily value and lacks any unnecessary garbage ingredients!<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I really like the design of the dropper. What a cleaver way to manage drops!! You just need to understand how to use it. One tip I can tell you is this: while dropping, try to keep the bottle in a straight vertical position (South direction or 270 degree). Do not tilt it. Do not shake it. Just keep it in this position and patiently wait for the drop to gradually falls. Also, do not hold the baby's mouth until you actually see the drop &#34;about&#34; to come off. Practice a few times and you will catch the right timing as when to hold your baby's mouth so the baby won't get frustrated from holding her/his mouth for longer time.<br /><br />A great product!! Good luck!

There is an awkward little crevice of space beside the couch and the doorway, and I couldn't find anything to fit there that wouldn't block the door a little bit. This table was perfect. Its small but its also very stable and makes a statement. It looks great against a blue wall and carpet.

11500	1	5	Y	Beauty	B0073RQMXC	Schick Hydro 5 Razor Blade Refills for Men with Flip Trimmer - 8 Count	Great shave, Great value!!!	I have been using these blades for about two years now, and find that I get an excellent shave from the blades.  I have a very tough beard, and find these blades do well at cutting, but I do have to make two or three passes in some areas to get a good shave, but I have this issue with other razors also.  I use the power razor with the vibration on.  I was skeptical of this idea, and never tried it before purchasing one of the razors about two years ago that was a great deal, and found the vibration was more beneficial than I expected.<br /><br />I also wanted to point out that the area above the blades flips back allowing you to shave the area above your lip directly below your nose.  I did not read the instructions and was initially concerned that the razor would not shave that location, but it works well once you know how the razor blade operates.<br /><br />Obviously, these are not cheap disposable razors.  One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  I generally shave 5 - 6 days per week, and can get at least 5 to 6 weeks out of one blade.  I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.<br /><br />I've used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.  I would definately recommend this blade to anyone who wants a good shave, and is mindful of the value in buying good blades over cheap blades.

I can definitely see how daily use if this cellulite smoothing mitt will give me beautiful legs. I will check back in and update after a few weeks of continued use. So far so good and the soap is amazing.

Overall, very fine drumming especially for the first and last sets.  Impact is significantly reduced by minimally creative camera work and unimaginative video editing.  Highly repetitive shots (which exclude some performer close-ups) seems to indicate that an inadequate number of cameras were used and only a single recording of each set was made.  Audio is an insult to the performers!  Stereo only.  Poor placement of microphones and/or inadequate audio editing results in a loss of stage sound from front to rear--only instruments up front (or close to the front) can be heard the best or at all.

3970	0	2	N	Camera	B00VUHJO22	LuckLED Outdoor 8 LEDs Solar Powered Light, PIR Motion Sensor, 10ft Detection Range With Dusk to Dawn Dark Sensing Auto On/Off Function	Great at first, useless after day three	I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. When I first pulled it from its packaging, I was surprised at how small it was, but I decided to follow the directions and get it set up. Then the first evening rolled around and it illuminated my entire front porch, much stronger than another outdoor light I'd been using, and the motion detection worked very well. I was amazed beyond words and I was so thrilled that first night that the next morning, I moved my previous outdoor light and put this one up instead.<br /><br />Day three rolls around and I noticed one evening when I went out that the light didn't work. (The other light died on the second day.) I thought that was odd. Then on the fourth day, I noticed that the light would come on around dusk--not unusual--and the motion detection would work as expected, but a few hours later, dead. For some strange reason, it seems the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge, which is odd considering I live in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight here, and this is placed in location that receives direct sunlight for nearly 10+ hours a day. I even tried cleaning off the solar panel, but still no joy. So, yeah, it still works, but only for a few hours each night and by the time it's fully dark out, it's useless.<br /><br />I've since moved my previous outdoor light back and although it's not as bright as this one, it's still going strong all night through.

They have a great sound, easy to use, hold a long charge and I can answer my phone at the same time.  The only negative i have is when you wear them for a long time, your ears get a little tender, not too bad.  I take them off, rub my ears and put them back on and that works.

Not sure if we got a defective product or what, but after 4 sets of batteries, its now in its final resting place â the upstairs closet toy box.<br /><br />And actually thinking back now, she actually was getting frustrated by this thing, it just goes straight, and back, but when it backs up it does so at an angle, I assume to go in a different direction, THIS is the frustrating part. Unless your child is using this in a 1000 square foot room that is all hard flooring and NO furniture, and assuming you child has the patience of Gandhi, this thing will just reverse into something, then you can only go forward, which again, bangs into something else, then reverse, at an angle, and then bangs into something again, and so the cycle continues till your child will probably run over to it and turn it in the direction to go straight again, unless they have brains of an adult and actually understands how to maneuver it, which is highly unlikely. With the amount of tech out there, one has to wonder why such limited driving capacities where applied. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED.

It's almost certain that I will inadvertently leave it on from time to time, draining battery life.<br /><br />I borrowed my daughter's 10&#34; pad to see about the functionality, and we agreed that the tablet holding &#34;stretchy bands&#34; worked better than it initially appeared would be the case, and the weight of her pad nicely balanced the easel function.  Without a pad inserted, it had seemed far less stable.<br /><br />The case closes to a secure and thin unit that offers moderate protection.  Again, not bad.<br /><br />Writing this, I've already had keys stick a few times, creating text liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike this.<br /><br />The instant &#34;Tap Launch&#34; feature is a nicely considered one, as are the iconographic function keys at the top of the keyboard,but overall the KeyFolio is going to offer a mixed bag of helpful features and needless frustrations to the user.  i'd say wait for the next version of this model.

This is the third Side Mates that we have tried in the last two weeks. While this one is slightly more flavorful than the other two, we did find the high sodium content very concerning (as we have with all others).<br /><br />We do appreciate the all-natural approach of these products (we love [[ASIN:B000CQ01GU Annie's Homegrown Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese]] and those can also be a bit high in sodium). So, one thing that you do (and we currently do) is to make this a small supplement to fresh steamed asparagus or broccoli. That way, the sodium content will not be as much of a deterrent.<br /><br />When added to your family's meals with caution, this product can be a nice treat.

Over the years I've had need for this shampoo and it really works well.  I found it's better than any of the other shampoos out there for dandruff or, for me, Psoriasis which also causes flaking.  It's going into winter which means dry air and more outbreaks of this.  I just bought another 6 bottles.  If only, it was cheaper but amazon has some of the best prices.  Just watch for sales and stock up.

The watch is definitely more difficult to program then the other one I tried, but nice you take the time t figure it out its fine.....if your on a budget or arent sure how much you'll be using it, this is a good buy, because it does work, just not top of the line

Whoever designed the remote control sleep mode feature needs to be fired. What were they thinking? How can you train a dog when the remote goes into sleep mode after a minute? I have to push and hold the button of the remote to wake it up for few seconds before I could correct the dog and most of the time it's already too late as the dog is already done misbehaving. So unless your dog needs correction every minute, the collar will not be ready when you need to correct a behavior. This is such a waste of time.
10996	1	4	N	Wireless	B00NM9OC46	Belkin Classic Case / Folio for iPhone 6 / 6S (Blacktop)	Nice and functional folio case	This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).<br /><br />Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.<br /><br />I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.

19547	1	4	N	Video DVD	B006MHZ32K	Bellissima	Do the right thing, Italian style!	*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />'Bellissima' begins with a radio presentation of Donizetti's opera L'elisir d'amore (The Elixir of Love). In it, a poor peasant, Nemorino, falls in love with Adina, a beautiful landowner. He relies on a charlatan's magic potion that he believes will help him to gain Adina's love. We're suddenly interrupted by an announcement of a casting competition for (real-life) director Alessandro Blasetti, who is searching for a child, age 6 to 8, to star in his latest film. 'Bellissima' is heralded director Luchino Visconti's third film and he wastes no time in introducing us to the crazy world of the Italian film industry, where a large gaggle of star struck stage mothers accompanied by their little tots are attempting to get their 'big break' in the movie business.<br /><br />Perhaps the most determined of all the mothers is our protagonist, Maddalena Cecconi, played by subsequent Oscar winner, the superb Anna Magnani. She lives in a working-class tenement with her equally 'passionate' husband, Spartaco, who both appear to be good parents to little Maria, the unprecocious child who Maddalena is convinced is the next 'Shirley Temple'. Like Nemorino in Donizetti's opera, Maddalena needs a magic potion to escape the drab existence which she perceives is her life--and that magic potion is the film contract which will enable her to live vicariously through her daughter's success. If Spartaco tries to convince his obsessed wife that motion pictures are just a 'fantasy', Maddalena will have none of it--every week there's another Hollywood picture projected on the big screen in the building's courtyard and Maddalena is enraptured whenever a big actor like Montgomery Clift makes his captivating appearance.<br /><br />Back to the initial auditions: Maddalena finally finds little Maria with her soiled dress by a pool--the rest of the stage mothers have already been let in to the studio and a seeminglykind director's assistant, Alberto Annovazzi, manages to get Maddalena and Maria inside the doors, despite the late hour.<br /><br />We break into Act II when Maria is chosen for a call back audition. Visconti doesn't only affectionately ridicule the naÃ¯ve Maddalena but Italian society in general, obsessed with their own self-interest. It begins with an older washed-up actress who shows up at Maddalena's door insisting that she has the ability to polish the little one's act and ensure she wins the film competition. Later Spartaco kicks the woman out of the house, but up until that point, Maddalena doesn't question her credentials, only hoping that the woman's instruction will give her little one, an edge.<br /><br />Due to her naivety about the film business, Maddalena is often gullible with those she interacts with; but she's also stubborn and aggressive. The obsessed mother butts heads with a photographer referred to her by Annovazzi and a dress maker, who hilariously doesn't buy into taking injections for preventative health (Maddalena works a nurse and gives injections to diabetics). More funny stuff: a hairdresser allows his young son to cut Maria's pigtails and Maddalena expects instant results during initial ballet lessons (dig the crazy ballet director's absurd dance across the studio floor!). There's also a great scene where Maddalena accuses Spartaco of beating her--the gossipy neighbors get in on the act, and take Maddalena's side (in contrast to their constant criticism of her).<br /><br />Visconti throws in a nice twist when Annovazzi hits Maddalena up for the 50,000 lire which was going to be used for the purchase of a new house. Annovazzi tells Maddalena he'll use the money to make the necessary connections to ensure Maria gets the screen test. The twist is that Maddalena doesn't seem to mind that he used most of the money to buy a scooter for himself. And when Annovazzi tries to seduce Maddalena during a visit at her mother-in-law's, Maddalena alsoisn't perturbed at all--she dismisses it as men's 'typical behavior'.<br /><br />Before the classic denouement, Maddelena meets a woman who she recognizes as a former actress in a couple of director Blasetti's movies. She warns Maddelina that the move business isn't what it's cracked up to be. After acting in two films, she didn't get anywhere, so she took the more mundane job as a film editor. Still, Maddalena is undeterred and believes there's still a chance Maria might be selected. So she finagles her way up the projection room and watches the rushes. To her chagrin, Maria breaks out crying during her screen test. Blasseti's colleagues (including Annovazzi) find this uproarious and burst out laughing. Maddalena confronts the director and chastises him and his colleagues for their bad behavior. Blasseti basically agrees with Maddalena and fires Annovazzi on the spot. But that's not enough to assuage Maddalena's hurt feelings and she storms off.<br /><br />At this point, Maddalena's world is shattered. Sitting on park bench, she clutches Maria and cries out, 'Help'. Back at the studio, Blasseti watches the rushes again and improbably sees a different Maria. Before you know it, the studio executives are offering Maddalena and Spartico a contract for Maria to star in their next picture. But Maddalena, no longer living in the world of illusion, does the 'right thing' and tells the executives that the film business is not for her daughter or for the rest of the family.<br /><br />Most of 'Bellissima' I would describe as comic but there are moments (particularly the ending) which are more touching and poignant. On occasion, the constant bickering between some of the characters, goes on a little too long but for the most part, Visconti's narrative displays brilliant insights into the unfortunate human phenomena known as selfishness. The many layered, brilliant performance of Anna Magnani and the supporting players is the type of acting you rarely see anymore. This is afilm that I highly recommend for those who enjoy watching classic cinema.

And some of the files we were moving were huge and took forever to load into Creative Suite. I started thinking of other options. Buy a new laptop..? Or make a fix somehow. After searching the internet I stumbled on a great article that you can load your OS on a SSD drive and move the optical drive out to create more space for a SSHD. I was overjoyed with the prospect and took my baby apart with a tool kit and followed the instructions to a tee. Now my MBP boots up in less than 17 sec, and opens multiple applications rapid fast. Make sure to max your RAM while you do the operation and rest assured you have a few more years on your machine. Place your files that are media related on the other drive and you are golden. I will NEVER go back to the &#34;moving parts HHD&#34; ever again. It's like a Ferrari under the hood and tons cooler than that overheating spinning disc. Now they are getting more affordable now is the chance unless you are going for the &#34;upgrade&#34; that you can't upgrade.

11756	1	3	Y	Tools	B0000CBINA	"Campbell Hausfeld Filter - 3/8"" NPT (PA212103AV)"	Didn't solve my moisture problem	The best thing I can say is this is relatively inexpensive.  My problem is moisture, not particulates - actual water droplets coming through the system.  Its been a losing battle to getting these out of my air, and this did not fix that problem. I live in western Washington state and the humidity here is very high, I have an &#34;array&#34; of two air filters (counting this) and just added a third filter with an additional desiccant water removal stage. That seems to have done the trick, no more water droplets in my automotive paint. The desiccant is at the end of the filters and the little beads don't last very long, so there is still a lot of moisture coming through the water separators/filters. The compressor, by the way has an automatic drain on it and is 50' away from the regulator, so I think I've done everything there I can on that end. I am open to suggestions.  And this comes with no mounting bracket or way to mount and support it.  I have this on the inlet end of things, so that means the air hose is supported by the pipe nipple coming off the outlet with this filter hanging in between.

I have had nothing but problems with the apple Tv from having the jailbreak this thing every month I just gave up on that. XBMC runs flawlessly on the Q and I havent had to do a thing to it. Just run and it works and I mean everything works. All the content I add to XBMC on here plays perfectly. Even the apple TV jailbroken wouldn't play some of my collection. The Nexus is closest but has problems with some MKV formats in XBMC. The Q is by far the most compatible device I have used for throwing any kinda media at and never flinches. It just works. High regards from me for this box and highly recommend for anybody that doesn't want to worry about if their media is going to be compatible or not with the box they own.

4227	0	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00HZT39AW	NaturaBest Green Coffee Bean Extract - With GCA - 100% PURE Green Coffee Bean 60 capsules	Green Coffee - Naturabest	In 2011, the journal of gastroenterology found that green coffee bean increased average weight loss by 5.5 pounds in THREE different studies. This was on an extremely low dose of only 200MG a day. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have bought a supplement like this, but the evidence is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Naturabest's bottle recommends a dose of 800mg, which is considered the appropriate amount for this supplement.<br /><br />I personally started taking this supplement 3 weeks ago, taking ONE dose per day, on my way home from work, before dinner. I really started noticing a reduction in appetite after about one week taking the supplement religiously, so it may take that much time or longer for you. Since I started taking green coffee bean extract, I have lost 6.5Lbs total.<br /><br />I have toyed with the idea of taking two doses per day, but I'm in no huge rush to lose weight (I have been overweight my entire life), and don't want to overdo it. I AM losing weight, and I WILL keep it off, and this supplement is helping me accomplish that in an easier way than I would have ever thought possible before. This brand seems on par in price with other brands, I picked this one because it was the first one that showed up when I searched on amazon and it wasn't dishonestly priced (sometimes I worry about products that seem a little too cheap).<br /><br />I will continue buying this product until I have reached my goal weight (22.5 more pounds to go), and then I will take this as-needed once I am there.

10822	1	4	N	Home	B00G00BTEA	McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System	Not my silver bullet for cleaning grout, but a really nice cleaner overall	[[VIDEOID:mo1NPCSAEORZPD5]]Over the past month, I've had the chance to audition the McCulloch [[ASIN:B00G00BTY0 MC1230 Handheld Steam Cleaner]], [[ASIN:B00G00BT72 MC1375 Canister Steam System]], and the [[ASIN:B00G00BTEA MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System]].  All of them come across to me as being well made, and none of them seem like they are overpriced.  Prior to trying these, I've owned a [[ASIN:B000I618NY Wagner 905]] for over four years.  The video shows the three McCulloch cleaners side by side, shows the included accessories, and discusses the individual cleaners a bit (sorry it's so long, but there's an outline at the front that shows when each segment is).<br /><br />I admit that I had high hopes about this model (and the slightly less expensive 1375) before they arrived because they are higher pressure cleaners than the Wagner.  I bought the Wagner to help clean grout in my new tile, but it never did a very good job with it.  I thought the added pressure might be the added boost that I needed.  To cut to the chase - it wasn't.  I might be using these wrong, but they just don't seem to get the grout any cleaner than a wet cloth does.  So, a disappointment for me on the grout, but I still recommend it if you're looking for a steam cleaner for the following reasons.<br /><br />Pros and why I like it:<br />(*) The steam mop attachment on this (and it's the same on the 1375) is fantastic!  Soooo much better and quieter than the one I've been using on the Wagner.  I think McCulloch did a great job with that.  I'm particularly aware of it because that all I really use the Wagner for anymore, and this model was just an overall better experience. I had stopped using the Wagner and had switched to a regular mop, but I believe that I'll switch back to steaming.  This and the 1385 are just so easy to use, and the tiles seem really clean afterwards<br />(*) The hole to pour water into is in a recessed area, so you don't have to use a funnel or have perfect aim to avoid a mess.  The shape of the opening serves as its own funnel.  I love that!  It's a big improvement over the Wagner model that I own<br />(*) Well made.  All of the accessories feel solid and fit well, and the main unit also seems solid<br />(*) Long power cord<br />(*) Long extension steam hose<br />(*) Really good set of included accessories, including a window squeegee and some extra spares not included with the 1375<br />(*) Fairly high pressure steam with an analog dial showing the pressure<br />(*) Comfortable handle and trigger<br />(*) Ability to adjust the steam flow with a dial right on the handle by the trigger<br />(*) Can wrap up the power cord like on a vacuum cleaner<br />(*) Extendable handle let's you easily roll it around like one of those roller carry-on luggage bags<br /><br />While it didn't help me with the specific problem (dirty grout) that I was hoping it would, it does a really nice job steam mopping my tile, and it's well made with a good set of accessories.  It's an enormous step up from the Wagner that I bought years ago, that's for sure.  This is the most expensive of the three McCullochs that I tried, and about twice as expensive as the Wagner that I've had for years, but I think it's the best value out of the lot.  The added convenience features, higher pressure steam, and good set of accessories put it at the top.  Recommended.

13252	1	3	N	Wireless	B0046EBTQ0	Mophie Juice Pack Air Case and Rechargeable Battery (Black, Verizon and AT&T iPhone 4)	I have mixed feelings about this battery and case	I carry my phone in a purse.  If you carry your phone in a pocket or in a belt pouch, the additional size this adds to your phone may be a problem for you.  However, the smoothness of this add-on means it will slide easily into and out of a pouch or pocket that is big enough for it.<br /><br />After using it a while on my iphone4 I decided I wanted a more protective case and so I took this off the phone and put an Otterbox Commuter case on my phone.<br /><br />I now carry a rechargeable battery [[ASIN:B005K7192G AnkerÂ® Astro 5600mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with built-in Flashlight for Apple: iPhone 5 4S 4, iPad mini, iPad 2, iPod; Most Android Phones: Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2, all Samsung Galaxy Series Smartphones; Motorola Droid Razr, X2, ...]] in my leather tote/briefcase.

12043	1	5	Y	Tools	B002OOZERY	Dorcy 41-4750 190-Lumen High Flux LED Cyber Light Flashlight with Alkaline Batteries, Yellow	Excellent Flashlight!	I bought this flashlight for my dad.  I had it on my wishlist for a while, but nobody bought it for me, so I figured I would get it for my dad.  I usually buy him 1-2 flashlights a year as gifts.  Kind of a running joke in our family that he knows he's either getting a flashlight or a pocket knife from me for a gift.<br /><br />He said this is one of the best flashlights he's ever owned.  In addition to him owning countless flashlights over the years, please also know he was a firefighter and used countless lights on the job as well.  This one gives off a blindingly concentrated beam, but still gives a nice lighter glowing outer ring to let you see things even if they aren't directly in the main beam.<br /><br />This flashlight will light up an entire room inside a house and can EASILY spotlight tree tops outside at 200 yards.  Highly recommended for camping, as an emergency light in your car, or any other use you may have.<br /><br />Two other benefits I've found to this light is that it's made of rubber, so your hand won't freeze in 3 seconds if you pick it up in the middle of winter if it's been in your car.  (Assuming you aren't wearing gloves).  Also, it's not round, so it won't go rolling off the counter or table if you set it down on it's side.  One downside about the rubber, is that it's not dog-chew proof as my dad learned.  His still works, but it has some teeth marks on the battery cap now.<br /><br />Ok, this review is long enough.  Bottom line, while I can rattle off 10 different lights and why you should own all of them, you can't go wrong with this one.  My dad and I both highly recommend it.  The battery life is also fairly impressive for the amount of light this thing puts out.

11438	1	4	N	Home	B006FJW5YY	Zenna Home, India Ink Galahad 3-Piece Bath Set, Antique Pewter	Rugged and Stylish	This bath set is pretty standard, with a tooth brush holder, liquid soap/lotion dispenser, and bar soap holder.  I find the combination of two soap holders redundant and would have preferred an extra holder for things like toothpaste.  The design is great, with a classical shape and pattern that would fit most bathrooms.<br /><br />The material is not metal, but it is thankfully not ceramic either.  Instead, it uses the rugged plastic resin that is common with new sets.  The paint color works well with chrome or nickel fixtures.  Because it is plastic, there is no need for maintenance to avoid rust.  Unfortunately, the pump mechanism is made of a cheap-looking plastic.  I can understand the main components being resin, but using a standard metal pump would have added some class and durability.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this bath set.  Apart from the pump, it adds to the look and functionality of my bathroom.

The only problem I just began to have is the battery life is not lasting like it did at the beginning, so what I am doing is constantly changing the brand of batteries to use.

It works fantastic for that, as well as for organizing various business cards, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Plus it is very stylish, stable, and easy to flip through.

I thought that as hard as I throw it and as much as she chews on it that it would stop making noise within the first week...I was plain wrong.<br /><br />This toy has been thrown at walls and across the room about a thousand times, chewed up so much that I had to sew the little noise maker back in the body when she finally got it out, has been submerged in a water bowl for hours, and I have to put it up, out of reach when we go to bed because she will bring it to me really, really early in the morning because she wants to play.<br /><br />I just bought 10 more as I never want to be without one.

11323	1	5	Y	Tools	B009VK6G8U	Black & Decker BDCDMT120 20-Volt MAX Lithium-Ion Matrix Cordless Drill	Excellent multipurpose drill!	This is an excellent tool!<br />I was originally given a Craftsman Bolt-On as a gift about two years ago, and have since purchased or been given most of the different tools that go with it<br />Unfortunately, this summer, the motor on the Craftsman burned up. Sears/Craftsman said &#34;tough luck&#34; because they only offer a 1 year warranty. I've always been a Craftsman fan, but this combined with the lower price of the Matrix set led me to make the switch. Black & Decker gives a 2 year warranty and their batteries are actually compatible with other tools they make.<br />All of the attachments, the batteries and chargers are compatible between Craftsman and Black & Decker.<br />The size and cost of this set is its real advantage, compared to a set of similar tools. I can throw a drill driver, impact driver, oscillating sander, skill saw, reciprocating saw, jig saw and compressor in a small bag and carry it with me easily.<br />The strength of the batteries is impressive as is the charge time.<br />I got this particular drill in some freak sale of $20 + $7 shipping. As far as I can tell it is brand new and works flawlessly. It took two weeks to get but it was well worth it!

15767	1	2	Y	Tools	B0009JXRFC	Smith & Wesson CK105H Extreme Ops Knife	Locking device defective	The knife has potential but I'm surprised Smith and Wesson allows their name to be associated with this Chinese made toy. The internal locking frame does not engage thereby making the knife less than safe. It is nice and light and the edge only needs to be touched up slightly to make it sharp enough to be serviceable. I attempted to take the thing apart to grind down the locking device to make it work but I don't have enough small torx bits that fit to get the job done. I purchased the knife to give to a young nephew but cannot knowingly give something that may cause a severe accident to anyone. I will keep the knife to use around the work shop, I grew up with non-lock-blade knives but things like this are unacceptable. No matter how inexpensive something is the basic safety feature must be tested and work before it is allowed to leave the factory.

11517	1	3	Y	Kitchen	B000SSR3DG	Rubies Harry Potter Printed Hufflepuff Banner	big banner, poor quality	Let's be honest... this thing is really chintzy. It's much bigger than I expected (I was expecting something the size of a book, but it's really the size of a poster), but the fabric is really thin and flimsy, and the printing on it is atrocious- it looks like someone tried to stencil on the Hufflepuff crest but the paint bled under the stencil. It's pretty ugly, to be honest. If I had known how poor the quality was, I would have never have gotten it.<br /><br />However, my 9 year old is a loyal Hufflepuff (she got sorted into that house and has been obsessed ever since) and ANYTHING having to do with Hufflepuff makes her happy, so the banner was a welcome addition to her room. Just not front and center.

3193	0	1	N	Sports	B009P9ROII	Weslo Cadence R 5.2 Treadmill	Watch out!!!! READ THIS BEFORE BUYING PLEASE!!!!!	I got this treadmill hoping I could start being active and working out regularly but sadly I wasn't able to with this. The first thing I noticed was the fact that the plastic pieces on it felt very cheap and low quality for the price it's being sold. I felt that I didn't receive a well made product that they advertise. Also, it would randomly shut off during use and would lose all of my progress during a specific work-out. This happened no matter where I plugged it in.<br /><br />After I dealt with that, I did some research like I should have from the start and found a treadmill here on Amazon that I absolutely love. I've had it for about a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about. It feels well made and does exactly what it should.

You won't regret getting the one I did, it's just not possible.

8866	0	5	N	Luggage	B00K26EV52	22 Inch Leather Duffel Travel Bag Mens Hand Luggage Weekend Holdall Gym Duffle	Great Choice For Traveling Needs!	Great leather duffle! The bag is huge and you can fit a lot of stuff into the bag. You will find a lot of room for all sort of different things one would want to take while traveling. I was pleasantly surprised by the separate compartments as described, and find separating items much easier. It's made with high quality material and is good looking both on the inside and outside. Just what I was looking for. Highly Recommended!

Don't rely on dimensions listed in the product info as the actual dimensions are the same as those the refrigerator has.  Half the price of what Sears/Whirlpool parts store is charging!!
11272	1	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00BLX9510	Samsung HW-F450 2.1 Channel 280-Watt Soundbar (2013 Model)	It was free with Samsung TV purchase	Great for free!  The TV was actually fine for sound, but this does add some depth and it is connected to the TV via Bluetooth, which is nice.  Also, turns on and off automatically with the TV, which is nice as well.
20269	1	5	Y	Shoes	B0054PIPYY	Salomon Men's XR Mission Running Shoe,Black/Black/Canary Yellow,10 M US	Salomon men's XR mission running shoe	Really like this shoe. Good fit and functions well on trail to road. I highly recommend this shoe for running, and for everyday casual use. Stylish too.
18210	1	4	N	Sports	B008VILMIW	SKLZ Ball First Trainer - Golf Ball Striking Trainer	Good ball-striking trainer mat for proper techniques.	Being a weekend recreational golfer, I'm always on the lookout for training tools to improve my game.  This Sklz Ball-First Trainer/Ball Striking Mat looked promising.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>The purpose of this training mat is to train proper ball striking techniques, specifically a proper lag, a downward strike, and a square clubface at impact.<br />>Made of a high visibility, flexible, and hefty material that's easily rolled up and stored into a golf bag.<br />>This J-shaped mat has holes near the four corners for placing golf tees to stabilize the mat.<br />>Clear visual club path guides which are at a very slight angle to the arrow/intended path of trajectory.<br />>Markers enable analysis of proper downward strike by looking at the divots created past the ball position line or impact point.  However, divots (dirt scooped up by the swing) made would only be visible on grass, not on artificial turf at some driving ranges.<br /><br />Slight Concern:<br />Initially, I was hitting this mat all over the place but the goal here is proper form, control, and swing path.  Gradually, the mat moved less, meaning my swing has improved.  My brother laughed at me for being such a precise, technical geek.<br /><br />How has the training mat worked so far?<br />I have used it during a practice round of golf with more experienced family members.  The mat has helped me line up properly and hit the ball squarely with the clubface with improved consistency and accuracy.  It not going to transform recreational golfers into pros overnight but does provide basic guidance for proper positioning relative to the ball for more consistent strikes and accuracy.  This mat will not replace an experienced golf pro instructor but will provide fundamental ball striking techniques training for most beginners and amateur golfers.

The quality of the sound is crisp and clear as well as very comfortable. You can't go wrong with these.
13374	1	4	Y	Tools	B005988I8O	"White 72"" Wedding Dress Travel Carry Cover - Superb Protection When Transporting Bridal Wear & Gowns - Showerproof & Breathable"	Great garment bag	This is a great garment bag for a wedding dress.  It has enough room for the train and the extra width at the bottom is great.  The only drawback is that it is not completely opaque.  You can see some detail of the dress, especially if the bag is held up to a light source.  Overall, I like it and am sure it will be useful for traveling to my wedding.

7119	0	5	N	Electronics	B00IRK0B2W	SunLabzÂ® AA Rechargeable Batteries (8 Pack) Highest Performance NiMH 2600mAh	Great batteries!	I bought a ton of these rechargeable batteries to give it to family and friends because I am trying to introduce how much better &#34;rechargeable&#34; batters are compared to old non rechargeable batteries. The pros are that these rechargeable batteries last longer and recharge themselves! What more could you ask for. It saves me money, so save yourself money by investing in these next time you need batteries for your remote control.
15285	1	5	Y	Outdoors	B002N4QAKA	Roller Derby Girls Tracer Adjustable Inline Skate, Medium	Pay Attention To Size!!	I bought these skates and accidently ordered the size small when I needed to order the next size up. My fault because I wasn't paying attention. The picture shows an example of the size 2-5 so I automatically ordered what I thought was going to be the size that the picture showed ,(even though the description does specify the sizes.). Instead I received the small size 12-1. Whoops!! Easily returned and I ordered a replacement pair the same day, (received a credit on my Amazon account once the returned skates were received). Once I got the correct size my girls couldn't wait to try them out! They are very easy to change sizes, which is very appreciated, and seem to be made of very sturdy materials. We have a semi-finished basement, so my girls, (ages 7 and 10), are having a lot of fun skating downstairs since it's too cold outside!

There is some variation in the color and I like it. It gives it that old friend feel. The strap is strong and the buckles and velcro are nicely done. You could easily put a 15&#34; laptop in it and have room left over. Or, you could use it as an overnight bag. Great bag!
6829	0	5	Y	Pet Products	B00HEVLJUS	BioPel Natural Flea & Tick Spray 8oz	A++ Product	I've been using flea and tick spray on my cat for years now since she's extremely sensitive to flea medication. She would foam from the mouth and have mild seizures from time to time. I just couldn't take the chances anymore and was forced to find an alternative.<br /><br />There's a lot of flea and tick sprays and was originally using one that has tea tree, but was told that it's bad for cats because of liver function. So I started looking for something more cat friendly.<br /><br />I've been using using this product for several months and just recently saw that they sell it a lot cheaper on amazon. It does kill insects on contact, but doesn't last more than a day. I would spray her daily before she comes or goes outside to not track anything in. It's more of an immediate insect repellent.
15658	1	4	Y	Automotive	B0014YG86G	Monroe 58643 Sensa-Trac Load Adjusting Shock Absorber	2 SHOCKS IN ONE BOX	Been great do far. Nice solid ride in the rear now. This product does come 2 to a box too.

I am a sound engineer for one band, and we go through cables in a hurry. I have done my share of repairs on cables and wanted to see the guts and stripped one down. The ends are soldered like they should be. I am always in a need of new hardware like this that is a very high quality, and an even better deal! Unless some fool cuts it in half i don't expect any trouble.

I don't know how it would look in other color options but Navy looks great and smart.  I am going to buy one for my mom as well.  Great price.
16791	1	5	Y	Toys	B00762BMOI	4CH 2.4GHz Mini Radio Single Propeller RC Helicopter Gyro V911 RTF White&Blue	great little heli.	This is a perfect heli of you're going from a co axial and want a 4 channel. The only thing wrong with the packaging is it says it's ready to fly...I would say that's not saying enough. It's not ready, it's wanting to fly! After the batteries were charged I took off straight up into the air and after the gyro settled it just sat there hovering. Killed it from 15 feet up and powered back and it recovered nicely. You can see the gyro doing it's work. 2 speeds is cool. Great little transmitter. Honestly, for the price of this little guy, I haven't flown anything better. Battery could last a little longer but it comes with 2 and the charger charges 2 at once. There are also upgraded batteries and more batteries. Enough ranting....this heli is great!

They came packaged so cute	These are very cute Kids Flip Flops by Mottos! I really love them! They came packaged so cute. Perfect for giving as a gift. I bought these for my son and he was so excited to get these in the mail. They come in such a colorful lunch box type box with a handle so you can carry it around. It also comes with a cute and useful black lightweight bag/backpack to carry things in. My son is 7 years old and wears a size 4-4.5 shoe. I ordered the size 5 Mottos flip flops. I wish these were just a bit bigger for him as they just barely fit. They are a slimmer type fit which is good for some people but for my son they were a bit narrow. Definitely order a size larger and you should be just fine. From what I saw, size 5 was the largest size available for me to order so that is why I choose size 5. My son really likes the cute charm that this comes with. He got a monkey on a surfboard. It is probably really fun to buy more charms and then be able to switch them. These seem very well made and like they will last. I am happy I made the purchase!

10900	1	2	N	Pet Products	B00CTRFE30	RELIQ Mineral SPA Shampoo, Jasmine	Not impressed	I bought this at a dog boutique and have used it on my Dobermans several times. It smells more like medicine than Jasmine and did nothing for their dry skin. Although the bottle itself works great and the price is cheaper on Amazon, it still isn't worth it. Even common pet store shampoos like Furminator and Pet Head are better than this. If you are looking for a natural shampoo that does a great job try Royal Treatment instead of wasting your money on RELIQ.

It's on the softer side so it's flexible and easy to put on (and it stays on!). It is completely transparent so if you have a decal or something directly on your 3DS, you can see it clearly. I personally bought this to protect the autographs I've collected on the front of my 3DS. I would definitely recommend this case!

The only problem is that the inner plastic bag shrinks up after using the heater function.Then you have to stretch the bag back to original shape. This is the second one of these that Ihave had and the original one (15 years ago did the same thing. It is just an aggravation when using it frequently. In any case it still makes my back feel much better.
12716	1	5	N	Luggage	B00PSQ94NU	"Solo Urban Universal Tablet Sling, fits tablets up to 11"", Grey, UBN210-10"	Good looking and practical	This bag is much more comfortable than those that carry the tablet horizontally. It's polyester with a polyester lining -- think about umbrellas or waterproof bags. The large central compartment is divided into two sections which could hold a tablet and a Kindle or a tablet and a book or papers.<br /><br />On the outside there are two more zipper compartments. The upper compartment is sized for a wallet or sunglasses and passport and the lower pocket has slots for credit cards and pens. The straps are sturdy and attached securely.<br /><br /> Overall, the look is sleek and simple, nice for men or women, and an excellent alternative to a backpack. Perfect for travel, for meetings, or for everyday commuting. Hard to imagine an improvement.

9745	0	5	Y	Video Games	B00J48MUS4	Assassin's Creed Unity - Limited Edition - PlayStation 4	The glitches are fixed and the game is awesome	I waited a while before I purchased this because of all of the negative reviews about lag and bugs.  I played Rogue first, and then Force Unleashed, I found this on Amazon for $30 near the end of December and assumed most of the glitches were fixed by then.<br /><br />I am about 68% of the way through the game and it is awesome!  The multi-player missions give excellent rewards and the que is never long on the playstation network.  There is a ton of missions all over the map and the companion app adds to the experience.  The battle system takes some getting use to, but after you've played for a while you'll be able to take on 3-4 guys at a time, as long as there aren't any snipers around :P<br /><br />If you are a fan of the whole assassin's creed franchise, you will enjoy this game.  If you came in late, say around ac 3 or 4?  It may not be as fun for you due to the lack of crazy naval battles and a throwback to the ground level exploration of ac1 through ac revalations.

He is a 115b rescue who enjoys driving me nuts with the squeaking and then gets himself upset when he cannot stop the toy from squeaking...so he'll pick it up and shake it so hard...trying to rip it...then he'll drop it; the little porker will rush in and grab it and Dr.DeSqueaker will take off and run around like his backside was on fire! Been at least 3 weeks now-all the squeakers are still in place. I'll step on it just to catch his attention. rescue pup's-they are as amusing, loving, playful and loyal as any 1st Place AKC breed! Always bought purebreds (Weim's and chihuahua's- you have a chihuahua rescue? Forget a security system, they let you know when the mail man is stuffing the mailbox or the UPS guy is heading up the drive or the neighbor is walking by w/there pup-possibly trying to leave you a phantom land mine on your front yard!) now, I'll only select rescues. They are just as spoiled. Just as appreciative. They learn hand signals just like my purebreds did. And like all canines, if you love, feed and care for them- they are like velcro.

It didn't sound any better than the speakers in my HTC One, but the light made it a fun desk toy.  The problem is that it only worked for a week prior to breaking.  The manufacturer won't honor their warranty, saying that the retailer I bought it from wasn't &#34;authorized&#34; by them to sell it in their store.

5965	0	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B004VN8VU8	Taylor Precision Products 24-Hour Weather Forecaster	good forecaster	if you don't have a forecaster i think this is the perfect one for everyone, very accurate and very precise when is about the temperature outside or inside your home, i think this one is one of the most complete forecasters because it will give you the current weather you are inside of your house and it can also give you the current weather outside of your house.<br /><br />works with AA batteries and it doesn't matter what brand you use because the forecaster doesn't wastes so much battery, the forecaster is like a TV control remote as much as you use it, you will not have to change the battery until like after two months or so.<br /><br />i really like this forecaster because i can every time i use it i immediately get the weather forecast of my location, i love it.

It's well crafted stainless steel men's large cross. Easy to wear, Detailed, elegant and durable. Stands out among many of the other crosses I spent hours searching for. Finally i got this one and it's Great quality, workmanship and features. I'm really happy with it! I would certainly consider buy from this supplier again. Thanks!

14687	1	4	Y	Automotive	B003VXN62W	UnderCover SC301P SwingCase Passenger Side Storage Box	Better than anything else	Got this for 2005 Dakota. Looks good, works well. My disappointment is that the catch that holds the case tight against the wall is a separate piece, which requires alignment and some guesswork. My pickup has a couple of extra holes in the side of the bed where I had to move the catch and align it correctly.<br /><br />I want to say that this is specific to my model. Other swing cases have a one-piece mounting bracket; this would earn a 5/5 rating. The shape of the Dakota bed prevents use of the one-piece and requires a separate catch, which must be aligned by the installer (you).<br /><br />This swing case is a good product, and the engineers did the best they could to make it work with a Dodge Dakota. Just know that it won't be as good and easy as it is on some other models. No reservations about buying again, just know what you're buying.

I bought this as a gift for my friend for her birthday.... so She got to open it on the 25th of November... and now I find that it cannot be returned... It is blurry, it doesn't focus, it is cheaply made .. Just a shoddy product overall... I would not mind if it could be returned but they gave less than a month to see if the thing was JUNK... Save your money... NOT worth it at all... You can do better with a 5.00 point and shoot disposable!
6316	0	5	N	Camera	B00AA2P9UE	Panasonic AG-AC90 AVCCAM Handheld Camcorder + 32GB SDHC CARD	I love it and would love to buy again!	I bought this last year, and have been used it for 4 events now. Mainly for christening, gatherings and celebrations. This camcorder is the best video recorder I have ever used. Why? because it's really great for low light and it has a great dynamic range. The footage with 30db noise is not that bad if you'll look at it on a big screen, I also love the batteries! You can consume the 16gb card at full HD 24p without dropping a single battery bar. The only negative side I found was the lack of shutter control, it does have a slow shutter but it's an automatic compensation. And hey! It has a 3 ring control for IRIS(aperture), Zoom(it actually has 3 zoom controls) and focus! Name the feature and it's there. This is better than shooting DSLR. In terms of picture quality, it's sharp, slow motion is smooth and great noise reduction technology.

18660	1	2	Y	Baby	B000G80RW2	JJ Cole Bundle Me Shearling Baby Hat, 0 - 6 Months	No stretch, baby never got to wear it	Because this was designed without any stretch to it, it is NOT made for 0-6 month old babies. It would have fit my baby girl just before she was 3 months old, and that was IT. But since I didn't need it till she was 3 months old (It was too big for her as a newborn) she never got to wear it. At three months it was too small for her head, and so I had to get rid of it unused. The material inside is satiny, too, which seems nice in theory, but it plays out terribly for warmth. All in all I consider this a completely useless hat.<br />If your looking for cute and warm, check out Smartwool's baby hats (socks, too!), and I also liked Baby Soy's baby hats.

It's really hard to damage it and overall it's a very durable and a stylish bag.

I wanted to use this a a second mounting plate on top of my SCT scope to attach a camera, required a lot of filing and drilling.

13831	1	2	Y	Automotive	B00GY2FBIO	Stayhold Cargo & Trunk Organizer for Auto, SUV, Minivan & Boats, Classic, Gray	The tote frequently slides around - this seemed like the perfect solution to keep it in place	I saw this product in Real Simple magazine and was very excited to order it.  I use a tote to hold several items I need available for work each day.  As I work at different locations, the tote stays in the cargo area of my mini-van most of the time. The tote frequently slides around - this seemed like the perfect solution to keep it in place.  Unfortunately, the velcro on the bottom does not work with the low pile, smooth carpet in my van.  The Stayhold pieces slide around, just like the tote does, rather than gripping into place.  I think the product would work with higher pile carpets, but it doesn't work for me. I am sadly returning the Stayhold and will look for a different solution.

The unit has a lot of features that I could not cover but it is a very well designed and powerful security system. I rated it at 5 stars and I recommend it to you and the video quality during day and night time can only be described as excellent. Motion capture works amazing and I get to see whenever guests pull in or random cars use my driveway to turn-around.

Before the sporn pet halter my arms ached and I put off walking the dogs, now can't wait to go for walkies.  I have recommended this product to several friends.<br />I do see that there is a chance of fraying on the part of the halter that locks it down to the correct.  I don't know if I have been careless adjusting it or it's just a small flaw.  If it's a problem later on I'll buy another, believe me worth it.

20143	1	2	Y	Books	1609619366	Wheat Belly Cookbook: 150 Recipes to Help You Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health	there are better choices I'm sure	"Con's about this book<br />1.  Recipes seem to be untested and do not produce the results in the pictures.<br />2  The first part of the book is just a rehash of the excellent book Wheat Belly.  If I had wanted to re-read the Wheat Belly book I would have read it again and not bothered to purchase a ""cook book"" that just rehashes the same thing for a number of chapters.<br />3.  While I really appreciate the author's research, writing and this important health information the cook book was a let down.  There are other cookbooks one can use their common sense and adapt to gluten free, a more thorough explanation on how to do that would have been appreciated more than some non workable recipes with disappointing results for the expense of the ingredients and the time involved.<br />4.  The challenge here is for a great cook to come up with some recipes that taste excellent, are gluten free and actually work.<br /><br />Wheat Belly is worth the price and more, the Wheat Belly Cookbook was a complete waste of money in my opinion.<br /><br />I love cooking and am used to being adaptable in the kitchen with decades of experience.  The first recipe I used, the pancakes with coconut flour was not remotely accurate in terms of flour/liquid proportions.  Following instructions left me with a mixture that could not be made into pancake.  I adapted it with more liquids and had a crumbly waste of expensive ingredients that turned to crumbs when trying to turn them on the grill.  I wondered if this recipe was tested at all.  After that disaster which ended up in the garbage disposal I'm not going to try any more of the recipes that are bread product replacements.<br /><br />While I haven't tried all the recipes my initial attempts have disappointed someone who loves to cook"

It's gotten a bit bent up just taking it in and out to clean it, so I finally decided to replace it. Some people seem to have received damaged filters, but mine arrived in pristine condition.<br /><br />Tip for using your Polaris: Odds are very, very high that if the Polaris is not moving around your pool quickly, this filter needs to be emptied and cleaned. If that's not the case, make sure that the plastic nuts that hold your wheels on are tight. If that's not the case, your wheels may be worn and the gears aren't turning them effectively anymore.

I got these for my 2 year old daughter. They fit snugly and the ear part is very comfortably padded. They're adjustable and lock in place on the adjustment you choose. They fold up very compactly and fit in the nifty little drawstring bag that's included. They are very well made & sturdy. She's always on her Zoodles &#34;Kid Mode&#34; app on either my or my husband's phone or tablet . It's a great, educational app with songs, video storybooks, etc. It keeps her quiet & engaged but in doctors offices, the car, church, the market or even while we're watching tv at home.....we have to listen to her shuffle through the app content. Not any more! These have worked wonders. The only flaw to me is the cord. I like that it's only on one side but it still gets in the way a little. They'd be 100% flawless if they were cordless. I'm going to order a 2nd pair to keep in the car.

14122	1	5	Y	Automotive	B000NCOKZQ	Battery Tender 081-0069-6 Ring Terminal Harness with Black Fused 2-Pin Quick Disconnect Plug	Super Awesome	I put these on my Harley, and immediately experienced a gain of 10HP at the rear wheel, and 15-foot lbs of toque.<br />They made my bike faster and louder.<br />Thanks to these battery tenders terminals, I have to take my wife along with me wherever I go on the bike. Otherwise, beautiful women throw themselves at me wherever I go, which my wife does not appreciate.<br />They also worked just fine with my existing battery tenders, but who cares about that?
18986	1	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B001PZ79LC	MXR MC404 CAE Dual Inductor Wah Wah	Great Wah Pedal	I could write a book on this pedal but I'll keep it short. It takes some time to adjust the MC404 to your taste but once you do it's wonderful. It's great to have two wah sounds within reach. Just remember if you're mounting on a pedal board that you will need to purchase or make some sort of aftermarket bottom plate so that you can secure it to your board. You will also find that it takes up extra board space because you need room to use the kick switches to access the boost and wah channels. There is the typical noise when you turn this on but it's better than most. Built like a tank and sounds great. It's worth every penny.

I've used this on both acoustic and electric guitars and it keeps both of them looking shiny and smooth. I highly recommend this kit to all guitarists, as it only sounds as good as it looks :-}

No issue in the airplane terminal at all! AS promoted, these strolling sticks agreeably fit into a knapsack or carry-on, are lightweight, collect effectively, and don't slip once their tallness is situated. They held up well on the stone steps and earth ways of the Amalfi Coast and Capri on a late outing. Whether that keeps on being valid over the whole deal stays to be seen, yet I was totally fulfilled by them. It is elusive strolling sticks that overlap this little (14&#34;) at any value or to discover less collapsible sticks at this cost ($50 for two, with material conveying cases included). I'm exceptionally inspired with these. I have been taking a gander at different collapsible poles now for around 18 months, and constantly figured I'd make good and purchase an arrangement of Black Diamonds.

12065	1	5	Y	Beauty	B00F008GFQ	Beauty Junkees Flat Kabuki Foundation Makeup Brush	Outstanding brushes!-BETTER THAN SIGMA	I purchased the five set kabuki brush which I'm realizing now was a little overkill (how many kabuki brushes can you have?) but I was highly intrigued by the set and the companies dedication.    First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won't spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.  When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.    The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma's kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma's have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won't be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.    On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes andsure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.    Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.

The Martin concerts are not particularly big, so this case may not fit a larger bodied concert. The headstock part of the case is wide enough that you can put a package of strings in flat (also just fits perfect as well, I didn't think looking it at they would fit but they did).<br /><br />It compliments the natural satin finish of my ukulele, its refreshing to not have to look at a black case.

12205	1	3	N	Books	0802408796	Before Burnout: Balanced Living for Busy People (Christian living)	Don't Get Burned by Following Jesus	"The authors in Before Burnout deal with perfectionistic attitudes and behavior.  It is interesting that Minirth and Meier write so much about perfectionism and burnout, when they freely admit that they themselves are perfectionists or obsessive-compulsive.  This gives the books a personal touch, however, since they sprinkle personal examples throughout their writings.  They describe two kinds of perfectionists: the quality and the quantity characters.  Like their former volume, How to Beat Burnout, the biblical Martha gets the bad rap.  Unlike the former volume, this one contains no references to sources of information and studies cited.  Though this might make for easier reading, the academic might be frustrated, especially when he or she needs more convincing.  Sometimes it appears that the authors characterize just plain Christian spirituality, truth, and accuracy as obsessive-compulsive (OC) (p. 29).  Even Moses gets labeled an OC (p. 52).  They appear to assume that middle-class values, i.e. people who tend to work long hours, are really OCs (p. 61), and even characterize those with a high need for achievement as OCs (p. 68).  Their psychologizing of Calvin's theology (p. 71) reminds me of Erik Erikson's description of Lutheran theology as ""anal repulsive.""  (Luther was sitting on the pot when the doctrine of justification by faith broke through upon him.)  As in the preceding book, idealism, unrealistic expectations, bitterness and forgiveness are primary themes for recovery.  Yet some of their recommendations appear awkward.  They want their clients to choose friendships that will benefit themselves (p. 134), somewhat reversing Christ's command to love our enemies.  And the later chapters of their book appears only loosely tied to OC or perfectionistic behavior."

I have a soft spot for the blues and this fills that spot.<br /><br />Someone said, if itâs just the music, then buy a cd. But the music is just the cake. It may be delicious red velvet cake, but you still need the frosting. And the frosting is the dance & production numbers, the costumes (both the guys & the dolls) and those big, shiny 1930âs era cars. Treat your sweet tooth and take a bite out this delicious film.

19764	1	4	Y	Office Products	B006JSR186	Sharpie 1800142 RT Retractable Grip Medium Point Pen, Blue, 12-Pack	Great Pens - find a different seller!	I love these Sharpie pens!  I often have to write on both regular paper and glossy brochure paper and needed a pen that could pull double-duty.  I also wanted one that wouldn't dry out quickly, so the fact that these are retractable means there's no cap to accidentally leave off or lose.  A couple times my coworker used one at my desk and left it with the point out. It was dry for a bit, but I just retracted it and let is sit for a few hours - work fine now!<br /><br />I originally bought a 3-pack at Staples to see if I liked them, but they were pretty expensive, about $8 or $9 for 3 pens.  When I wanted to order more, I came looking for a better deal.  This is the best price around, even adding the shipping charge.  The problem is that I haven't received the pens!  It's been 10 days and not only do I not have them, Amazon sent me email stating they can't get any shipment info from the seller.  I haven't been charged yet, but I'd really rather have the pens!<br /><br />UPDATE: I did receive the pens, at about the 12-day mark.  A few of them seemed dry right out of the box.  I revived one or two of them by dampening the tip slightly and using it until the ink started working again, but one had to be thrown away.  I still like these pens, but I'm also keeping an eye out for a more affordable alternative.  They're now up to about $35/dozen!

The bad thing about them is their very spicy smell and taste which, even when you take them with meals as you are supposed to can leave a lingering aftertaste in your throat and mouth.<br />They do lead to stomach and intestinal upsets once in a while which I'm not sure if this makes the amount of pills and the cost worthwhile.

The wider silicone ends of the tongs allow you to grasp what ever it is you are trying to grasp and there is much less dropping of food. The silicone padded handles make them extremely comfortable to use. Also, the handles are wide and hefty enough to enable the user to get a good grip and keep it. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a quality silicone tongs at a reasonable price. The silicone feels great in your hand and they are easy to use. The color is a nice red. I also bought the other utensil sets that are made by this company: the Silicone Kitchen Utensils Set (5 Piece) - Hygienic Solid Silicone Design - with the whisk and basting brush; and the Premium Silicone 5-piece Silicone Utensil Set (5 piece) with the ladle and slotted spoon and regular spoon.

3778	0	1	N	Lawn and Garden	B0030GEXUO	GreenWorks 21212 4Amp 13-Inch Corded String Trimmer	GreenWorks 21212 4 Amp 13-Inch Corded String Trimmer	There are so many negative reviews, and now I understand why. At first, it seemed light, easy-to-use, and a decent product. Then it kept getting wrapped around the shaft. I tried everything, but no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to work again. So I just gave it up and tossed it in the garbage. Everyone says you get what you put in. You get what you pay for. But I feel like this was genuinely a rip-off, regardless of price. If I pay $15 for something, I shouldn't be expected to throw it out.
1825	0	4	N	Sports	B002HWNVZK	JOOLA Inside Table Tennis Table with Net Set	Great table especially for the price!	We love this table.It's sturdy and seems durable, which is good for  teenage boys. I would defiantly recommend this table.

515	0	3	N	PC	B0079T2KHG	Cooler Master NotePal X3 - Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with 200mm Blue LED Fan	"This is not the best one. It is advertised as 17"" cooling pad"	This is not the best one. It is advertised as 17&#34; cooling pad, but my 17&#34; laptop hangs off the edges a good inch on each side. The plastic feels cheap, this isn't something you would put on your lap. Also the fan is really weak, but  it is quiet.

I wasn't particularly well-versed in the ""Adlerian"" method of psychology the author uses to analyze all of these guys, but actually found it to be a fascinating way to approach writing a biography. The book spends a lot of time making connections between early experiences and future behavior, and, definitely made a solid contribution to my research.!!!"

I first started using them, because they were easy on the fingers. I don't need easy on the finger strings anymore, but I kept up with these, because I like the way they feel, the way they sound. D'Addario has never let me down. I can't recommend their strings highly enough.

14679	1	5	Y	Furniture	B002V8O4ME	Avery Complete Bed with Wood Frame and Mission Style Design, Oak Finish, King	Solid piece of furniture.  Know your bolts before starting assembly.	We're real happy with this headboard and frame.  The slats are made of wood underneath and there are extra support legs across the underside that you can't see in the photos.  It's a solid piece.  Be sure to look at the pictures for assembly or you might get something backwards.  And the screws/bolts were a touch confusing to us as the sizes were very similar but different making it easy to use the wrong bolt on the wrong piece.  I suggest lay them out and clearly understand which bolts are which before starting.

11795	1	3	N	Home Entertainment	B00DQBA4D8	Seiki SE22FR01 22-Inch  1080p 60Hz LED TV (Retro TV)	Well, it's CUTE!	Form:<br /><br />The TV has a red-Formica-chrome  look of the fifties.  I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big  and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier.<br /><br />Function:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics.  The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p.  Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good.  It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection.  The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set.  Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />If you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you. If you're looking for a small TV (with headset connection) for your kitchen ,kids room or dorm room  you  might want to keep looking.<br /><br />note: After re-reading this review I can see I didn't add much helpful information for the TV but everything has been so competently and completely covered I don't know what I could have added.  It would have been helpful it there was a back view of the TV on the product page, showing all the connections, but I'm here to review the TV not the advertising method.

This blu-ray is great.  The picture and sound are sharp, and I love how most blu-rays will remember where you left off and start from there.  While most shows take a little time to build up steam, this show is funny from the start.

From my teen years to my adulthood I have suffered from wrinkles on my face. I didn't know the reason of it but it really disgusted me when I looked in the mirror. I'm in my early 30's and my face looked more like of a 55 year old. I needed immediate assistance and luckily I stumbled across this Botox alternative acid and to be honest, I've never felt more confident in myself. My deep wrinkles are barely noticeable and I've only been using this for a short time. Can't wait some more time to pass and I'll finally look how I wanted to.

Periwinkle and Side Table Drawer play particularly important roles, but all the gang is here: Mailbox, Mrs Salt, Mr Pepper, Paprika, Slippery Soap, Shovel, Pail, Tickety Tock, Magenta and even the Purple Kangaroo.<br /><br />A particularly great moment is the explanation of how to compose a song, made by G-Clef the Keyboard, who speaks and sings with voice of Ray Charles and by Notes, who are voices by the a capella group The Persuasions.<br /><br />There is humor, there is emotion and there is of course a very happy ending with a great singing finale. A wonderful film for little kids. Enjoy!

10611	1	3	Y	Books	088347462X	Simple Changes	Inner Freedom	Wicks provides the reader with a relatively concise, if not somewhat redundant, path to helping gain inner freedom in this little book.  Providing a 30 day &#34;home retreat&#34; in the appendix, as well as an additional reading list, the book contains both practical advice and practical approach.  Wicks moves perspectives from psychology to spirituality in a way that doesn't quite mesh well, and as noted, the message gets a little redundant - which may belie both the simplicity and difficulty of the task at hand - namely the management and elimination of the head trash that holds us back from personal and professional growth.  The book is OK - but there are more interesting self-help type books out there.

These looked like they would work and aside from an initial mistake in sizing (advice elsewhere said they ran small, but the one I ordered first was way too big, so I reordered my regular and they fit), I love them.  Still miss the KSO trek's soft leather feel (especially the sole), but these will do.  The laces are a pain, and they do come undone sometimes, and the heel chafed at first so I had to wear bandaids until I toughened up, but I think these will have to be my KSO Trek replacements for now until Vibram reissues them (please oh  please!).
12403	1	5	Y	Kitchen	B002PY7AYI	Thermos Stainless King 16 Ounce Travel Mug with Handle, Midnight Blue	Allows me to drink my coffee!	I really like this mug. I had gone through a few other brands and experienced varying degrees of failure. Some don't keep the drink hot, others do but dispense coffee like a dribble glass; more drips down your shirt than goes into your mouth. This one does it all well. I am amazed at how long I can forget my coffee someplace, then come back to it and it's still hot. Impressive. I have not experienced the problems with the handle that others have described here, but I would offer one bit of advice: if you are using this primarily in the car, get one without the handle. The handle really doesn't make handling the cup any easier, and it causes the cup to fit awkwardly into my van's cup holder. If I had it to do over again I would have ordered one without a handle, but that is my fault, not the mug's, so I give this 5 stars.
893	0	3	N	Beauty	B00132ZG3U	Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer, Grey/Black	Ceramic	After learning about the wonders of a ceramic flat iron, I thought all things must be better in ceramic and if the flat iron could do such wonders to my hair, lord only knew what a ceramic hair dryer might achieve. I have to say it is just a hair dryer. Nothing more, nothing less, and if it had only sold itself as such I would give it five stars. but by the description its ions and ceramic parts will turn your hair into a sleek mane of model hair. It is just a hair dryer.
8325	0	5	Y	Automotive	B00OSZ2N08	Car Garbage Can (Black) by Logiclux	I love it takes up not much space! Brown/Black	For the longest time I've been using a small garbage can with a makeshift device to have it on the back of the car seat. But it was so bulky and a pain. This bag is amazing and I wish I would have known about this type of thing before. It fits easily onto any seat of any car. It just wraps around the headrest (or wherever you wish top put it). It already has some trash in it and I love it takes up not much space. I haven't tried anything liquid in it yet, but it does look leak proof as the info says it is. I'll probably buy some more of these for our other car and maybe for friends too. For the price its hands down worth it!
14031	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B00874BSGG	Pet Waste Disposal Bags - 1000 Dog Poop Pick Up Bags	Good value! Best bag, best price I could find!	Very convenient.  Keep a roll or one bag in your pocket at all times.  Easy to pull a bag off the roll by sliding thumb nail along the bag to the bottom where there is a little slot where your nail catches in and the bag can be easily removed from the roll.  There is no plastic tube in the center which makes the roll flatten a little in your pocket and is more comfortable.  Who needs a dispenser!  Just more plastic junk that breaks.<br />I've used them for several weeks now without any problems whatsoever:  No seams splitting, no smells, no see through.  The bag is long enough to tie in a knot.  My dog is a French bulldog so the size is adequate..  The bag is probably big enough for up to medium - medium/large dogs.  I recommend this product without any reservations.

We have several electric dispensers around the house and we love the automatic spray, but the cost makes the purchase infrequent.
8230	0	5	Y	Tools	B00XQUHPV8	Small Pocket LED Zoom Flashlight - High Intensity 5W Cree LED - Aluminum Alloy Torch - 130 Lumen - Metal Clip - Green	Fantastic Light	I am fortunate to receive this for free for my honest feedback. I use this everyday. Tiny and extremely bright. I use in emergency department as penlight, clip on hat when fishing at night, in my pocket for everyday carry. I have tons of flashlights but this is by far the best overall for money Great product! It arrived as how I expected it to be! Kudos to the seller for a job well done! I'd really recommend it to my family & friends!
12439	1	5	N	Grocery	B00GKR3G80	ESP Emporium Organic Black Tea Blend, English Leaf, 1.76 Ounce	You won't be disappointed	I love tea!  I've actually become a bit of a tea snob.  I find it challenging to purchase tea online, without being able to smell and see it in person.  I took a chance on this organic black tea.  I was not disappointed.  It's delicious!  Very robust and fragrant.  It steeps well and the blend is wonderful.  I'm so glad to have found this gem!

I was very skeptic in buying gift for my niece on her birthday. I already bought a perfect gift for her but I wanted more. These very cute and lovely pouch purse was the gift to be added on the gift box. She was very thrilled when she received and can't  wait to use. I bought one with her favorite color and she was even happier. I would recommend this also to you if you are looking for lovely gifts that little girls would enjoy.

This pick is the best among the rest. I have tried almost every brand but I say that this is different. 12 pcs of picks are really fantastic! They are durable and don't slip easily.
20307	1	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B008KECFRO	Sony BRAVIA KDL42EX440 42-Inch 1080p LED HDTV (Black)	Great TV... Beware of ordering from Amazon	We wanted a TV that had a nice picture for a nice price.  We've been pleased with our current Sony TV, just needed one a little larger.  We ordered the first TV and the box and TV arrived damaged.  We figured this was just a fluke so we returned that one and ordered another TV.  The second arrived more damaged than the first... all the Styrofoam corners were smashed and the box had been punctured at the bottom, breaking the area of the TV where the stand sits.  We returned that one and went to a B&M retailer to purchase the TV.  It appears that the damage is occurring in Amazon's warehouse before being sent to the customer, as both times the box appeared to be punctured by a forklift and then re-taped over that area.<br /><br />I highly recommend the TV, just purchase it from somewhere other than Amazon!
7241	0	5	N	Camera	B00GJRCPRO	DRIFT HD GHOST-S DIGITAL VIDEO ACTION CAMERA CAMCORDER	best comparing to others	It is capable of shooting wide size of 1080p at 60 fps and smaller sizes at up to 240 fps, which blew my mind I have never seen a smaller cam like this before. And it is waterproof right out of the box and requires no additional housing.<br />The rotatable lens gives you a wider view of everything.<br />Its battery last up to 3.5 hours and it has built in compatibly with smartphone apps.
16263	1	1	N	Home Entertainment	B0014H16V0	Samsung BD-P1500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player (2008 Model)	Won't play new disks even with update	I began having trouble with not playing newer Blu-rays this several months after buying it and swapped it for the newer player in my bedroom. I did a firmware update before doing so but still had problems on the rare occasion that I watched a new Blu-ray in my bedroom. Eventually, I swapped it for a new player.<br /><br />Today, I updated it, hoping that the problem was just with the couple of disks I'd had problems with, but no dice. It simply rejects Blu-rays of the last couple of years, even with the firmware update.<br /><br />It still plays DVDs and old Blu-rays (like Spider-man 3, which came with it I think) but not newer stuff. With Blu-ray players now much cheaper, with fast loading times (this is a dog), and offering streaming services, it's obviously time to junk this, but I'd really expected to be able to give it to my brother, who needs a player with component jacks because he has a pre-HDMI TV.

Best I can tell, this must by the company that makes the HD boots as they are identical in EVERY way except for the the HD logos and the price.  $180 for HD -- $110 for these.  I'll take these.

14792	1	1	Y	Tools	B000N51O5M	David White 48-SLL2 Self-Leveling Laser Cross Level Kit with Laser Pole	Sold a broken product...beware	Laser not accurate. When you turn the laser the line runs uphill 3/16&#34;. Meaning there is aomething wrong with the machanics inside. Laser is only 8' wide. So it needs to be turned a lot to shoot a room. This is the sellers fault for not checking this. The previous  owner broke it and sold it, and got away with it.
19571	1	2	Y	Office Products	B00DQOAPFM	Brother Printer MFCJ650DW Wireless Color Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax	Not happy at all about this	After trying for at least a dozen times to get this printer connected via WiFi and in all ways possible it would just not communicate with my system. I finally gave up and connected via USB which doesn't help at all because I want to be able to scan print and Fax from two different computers. I had to buy a USB switch which sometimes works and sometime doesn't. Not happy at all about this. It says it cannot find my network when it is in the same room and about three feet from the WiFi unit. I do believe I got a faulty printer that does not work by WiFi.

I used to have 5 or 6 days of constant ringing in my ears before starting with this supplement about two months ago. Yes...it takes a while to work, but it's great that it's working smoothly after a period of time.

Eat healthy, Exercise and Take this product	Like millions of people I have tried losing weight a ton of times. I tried just exercising, but I only lost about five months after two months. So, I tried exercising and eating healthy, but I only lost about five more months after about a month. So, my mom told me about this product that she found online, Raspberry Ketone Liquid drops, and I ordered it. After using this product, plus exercising and eating healthy for about three weeks I lost ten pounds. So, I say, if I person wants to lose weight they should eat healthy, exercise regularly and take this product. This weight loss regimen is working for me so what do you have to lose, give it a try. I don't usually recommend products or do reviews, but I wanted everyone to know how I have been able to lose weight and feel better.

We put in in our children's playroom for movie watching and it works fine for that purpose. This is not the choice for a main DVD player as it lacks any wifi capabilities for streaming Netflix, Pandora or You Tube. It is also ideal for a vacation home or furnished rental property.

Within minutes I was in the testing mode. As for the Fortress system, ughh unnecessary headache! 2 hours later the system was still not communicating properly. Long story short...I returned Fortress and kept my Skylink system as it works as advertised, was easy to set-up, has no contracts and plenty of sensors I can add at very good prices. If you want to save money, Skylink is the source!

8503	0	5	N	Grocery	B000JWGFQC	Dixie Carb Counters Blueberry Cream Muffin Mix	Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize	Okay. I was extremely skeptical of these little water-filled baggies of &#34;&#34;fake noodles&#34;&#34;.<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BTMDALO/<br /><br /> I had read horror stories about the fishy odor and rubbery texture. As a low-carb junkie, I REALLY missed the sauces and meals associated with pasta. Enter the Miracle Noodle.<br /><br />Here's what I feel should be addressed:<br /><br />- THE SMELL. Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize, or maybe I'm at a genetic disadvantage with a lowered sense of smell. But whatever the case, I did NOT find the smell oh-so-offensive as others have described. I actually braced myself as I cut the pouch open the first time -- ready for the worst -- but I didn't smell anything until I literally put my nose an inch above the open bag. And I'd describe the smell as more of a &#34;&#34;brine&#34;&#34; than a &#34;&#34;fish&#34;&#34; odor. C'mon guys, it's not bad.<br /><br />- THE TEXTURE. I've found that the texture varies greatly on the preparation of the noodles. My first time eating them, I was rushed and starving... so I ate them straight out of the microwave tossed in pesto sauce. Not so great -- they were definitely rubbery this time. BUUUT, the SECOND time I prepared them, I made a creamy based sauce (melted 1 oz. cream cheese, 1 Tbs heavy cream, and 2 tsp. coconut oil, topped with some curry powder) and LET IT SIT for 2-3 minutes after preparing the dish. This way the sauce reeeally soaked into the noodles and gave them a softer and less-rubbery texture. Oh, and I just nuked them in the microwave this time, too. THIS time was good. Definitely a more &#34;&#34;noodle-like&#34;&#34; texture. I ate every last noodle!<br /><br />Also, some tips I've read are to microwave the noodles twice PRIOR to preparing them. By this, I mean: Open bag, rinse in warm water, microwave 2 minutes, rinse again, microwave for another 2 minutes, rinse one last time. At thispoint they're ready to prepare as desired.<br /><br />I'm pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend these to people watching their glucose levels or anybody wanting a zero-carb option.

2555	0	1	N	Video Games	B00002ST7F	Sonic the Hedgehog 2	MARIO WILL ALWAYS BE LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF SONIC!	The truth is Sega hasn't couldn't escalate after Genesis. In fact, Sonic had to carry them & Nintendo was the one who made Sega popular by being their rival; which Nintendo was & STILL is light years ahead of washed up Sega so it was no comparison.<br /><br />Sega is aware of how crappy their company is cause in the 90s they swore they would never team up with Nintendo; but now they barely make just games instead of garbage systems & even team up with Nintendo so once again Nintendo would save them. The only good game in the Sonic series was Sonic 3+Sonic & Knuckles & that was just average. Sonic 1 was ok but overrated & lacks replay value, Sonic 2 was extremely easy & overrated as well, Sonic 3 was too short & a waste of time. Instead of just going ahead & releasing the full game of Sonic 3, Sega wanted to make a money grab; the other Sonic games pretty much sucked.

If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly have a cup hot or cold, both are delicous. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do. Plus it is literally the only tea I've tasted that actually rivals lipton without even adding any sweetener to it, really really good.
9256	0	5	N	Luggage	B00M4IG136	Laptop Courier Messenger Bag Leather Satchel with Detachable Shoulder Strap Fits up to 14 Inch Devices	Best Quality Leather	The perfect leather bag I was looking for my college classes. Be sure to buy this only from ECOCRAFTWORLD as I have been scammed before by a seller showing the exact same picture and receiving a low quality bag when it delivered. EccocraftWorld provides the true quality, and gives you the exact thing shown in the picture. The leather is amazing, soft and well-polished, the stitching is terrific and holds the leather firmly. It's very comfortable to carry because of its light weight. Over all, I'm really happy with this amazing bag by EccocraftWorld.

Ha, amirite?	I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category.

17266	1	5	Y	Home	B0015ASJIY	Eureka Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner, 4870MZ	Vacum For An Apartment	Excellent value for an apartment or home that requires more basic vacum functions. The bag space is very large, & I have not had to change the bag yet (owned the vacum over 4 months & I vacum every week). The only negative is that it seems to tip over easy, & the clip on holder for one of the extra pieces snapped off when this happened. Other than that, the suction seems to be stronger on carpet than hardwood floor, but I am a thorough &#34;vacumer&#34; and will go over a space several times. The cord is of a generous length, & is well-made.

I fell in love with Ryley and Ashleigh in the first book. I knew their story couldn't be over. The way Ryley tried to make Ashleigh suffer like he did almost brought me to tears, but those quickly went away when they had their steamy reunion. I mean who doesn't enjoy a little passion in their reading? Camden has real issues going on and I would love to know what this all stems from. You should read the first Gloves of novel to fully understand what is going on in this one, but you won't be disappointed. L. P. has captured my heart with all her books from the first one I read. I look forward to reading more.

3097	0	1	N	Office Products	B000K5WIVO	HP 92 (C9512FN) Black Original Ink Cartridges, 2 pack	I hate this crap!	Ink is such a ripoff, but especially this kind. I hate HP ink! And let me tell you WHY! Because the crap hardly lasts and it's a complete ripoff. ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.<br /><br />To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business. I print two copies of every return, one for my records and one for sending in (I don't e-file). I printed 38 pages this year, 2014. Let me spell that out for you: T-H-I-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T P-A-G-E-S...And that's it! The ink is GONE. R-I-P-O-F-F<br /><br />I don't know what the solution is for this BS printer and ink problem we have right now, but I know it's NOT buying these HP cartridges because they suck!

I did not expect this quality from a low cost TV. Sound is pretty good. When you set up the TV, go to &#34;Audio&#34; section and manually set the bass level to +8, and the treble to +3.

It doesn't really go deeper that my dog's top layer of fur, and even then, barely gets any. And the few hairs in does collect are impossible to get out.<br /><br />So, for anyone else who may have been steered in this direction in regards to their dog, I wouldn't recommend it.

11412	1	5	N	Grocery	B00KM9PJ50	I HEART KEENWAH QUINOA CLSTR GNGR PNUT, 4 OZ	it's hard to eat just one serving of these!	I got a 4 ounce bag of these through a subscription box service and it was a challenge not to eat the whole bag in one sitting (each serving is one ounce).<br /><br />First, since there's currently not much product information on the page (including no &#34;Nutrition Facts&#34; box):<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Quinoa (Whole Grain Quinoa, Quinoa Flakes, Quinoa Crisps), Peanuts, Tapioca Syrup, Raw Sugar, Crystallized Ginger (Ginger, Cane Sugar), Honey, Brown Rice Crisps, Almond Oil, Baking Soda, Salt<br /><br />These are gluten free (certified) but obviously not vegan (honey). This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).<br /><br />Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).<br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious. I'd definitely consider buying these in the future (as well as looking for other flavors from the same company).

Without it I couldn't get the factory rusted and tightened nuts and bolts loose without stripping them with the hand wrenches. It worked like it was advertised. I'm glad I went with the larger tank (6.5 gal) and lower powered motor instead of the higher power (14 Amps model) with a tiny tank (1.6gal) I would recommend this air compressor for anyone who needs a compressor to blow out computers, fill tires, run basic hand tools. It has enough to knock off the smaller than 17mm bolts and makes working on the car much quicker than hand wrenches.

The luggage is precisely as pictured (we ordered the purple one).  It's cute and the colors are vibrant.  Our daughter loved it and loves having her own suitcase.  The quality is fine; not superior, not inferior.  The suitcase got banged around a bit by the airline because we checked it and shows some scuffs as a result.  However, it doesn't look too bad and the luggage will certainly get more use by our daughter.  I wouldn't buy this if you intend to use it frequently because I don't think it will have that much longevity under circumstances where it is subject to repeated banging around.  For infrequent to moderate use it's fine and holds a good amount of clothing.

I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it!

I am using it with the BIC sub thru an Onkyo power amp with built in crossover. The tweeter has great dispersion which I need. The speaker is getting about 40 watts rms. I am using the subwoofer for the bottom end because with a 6&#34; speaker the bass won't be as deep or strong as I want.

It looks good (as shown), but you cannot adjust the back and the bump at the bottom means that you have no support for your back at all if you like to sit upright when working.the chair spins by itself even when sitting on it.the hand rest are very wide apart and not adjustable. It is inconvenient.

I'm very happy with the quality of it. I think so far my favorite thing about it is connecting my phone to it wirelessly and searching YouTube while it plays my TV que. The only thing I didn't like was the mounting instructions. They had all the instructions on how to wall mount it but none on how to mount it on the stand. The pieces weren't labeled so I had no idea what was what but I did eventually figure it out. I've only had a few hours to watch it so I haven't had full pleasure of a lot of the features the TV has to offer. I did however experience the 3D, omg best thing ever!! I cannot wait to watch Avatar!
15979	1	5	N	Books	1439198950	To the Last Breath: A Memoir of Going to Extremes	Inspirational	One man's journey to conquer the physical becomes his emotional deliverance. Francis Slakey begins his quest with a goal in mind - set a record, to be the first man to climb the highest mountain on every continent and to surf every ocean. The challenge he sets out in front of him seems simple at the time: 8 peaks, 4 shorelines, 12 experiences to check off his To Do List. He is driven by his indifference to the world to shrug it off in this independent series of adventures. The world, as it turns out, would have none of that.<br /><br />Slakey is brutally honest about his own agenda, and about how he failed others in following it. At first he failed others, that is. But as he slowly began to open himself up to the amazing experiences surrounding him at every turn, his agenda changed. He changed. He found that it was possible to evolve from someone serving himself to someone serving others. And he didn't do it with a mushy gushy love story, although love was present. He did it by finding that man within himself, the one that always existed. Just as he encourages us to do, simply by telling his story.<br /><br />Inspirational and exciting, follow Francis Slakey as he scales mountains, crosses plains of ice, hunkers down during blizzards, and dodges bullets in an around-the-world adventure that is like none the average joe will ever have. Slakey shares with us his most amazing experiences and his darkest moments and through it all we discover a man we can all learn from. Read it for the adventure, sure, but take away from it the perspective.<br /><br />I received this book for free through the Goodreads First Reads program.

I haven't given it to her but I did open it up and make sure everything was looking good: I'll do my custom wrap before giving it to her soon. I've seen a lot of these ornaments in action in the past and they really shine and sparkle like you've never seen. In my opinion the price is kind of steep but I realize that there's a lot of workmanship that goes into each and every one. I know she'll love it!

19916	1	2	N	Wireless	B00CTGDSQQ	Huawei Ascend Plus H881C STHUH881CPWP Prepaid Smartphone Straight Talk	Updated: Huawei big name in global market, just not in USA	"** Update October 2014 **    Well after about 14 months of use this phone crapped out. It was not dropped, submerged, or otherwise abused. One evening it just decided to quit. The screen started to flicker and stay on, all buttons became unresponsive, it's dead. Pulled and re installed the battery, same thing. Completely unusable.     As time went on I became less and less satisfied with this phone. It developed tremendous lag with many functions. Sometimes I would tap a name in my contact list and it would take 15 seconds or more to bring up the call screen and complete the call. Beyond that, aps would constantly bomb out. It became a very frustrating phone to use. Honestly, I wasn't all that upset when it died, at least I could look forward to something else. I can no longer recommend this phone based on the entire 14 months of use and it's death.     I found a killer deal on a refurbished LG Optimus Showtime and have been using it for a week. So far I love it. It looks and works like new. Time will tell if it ends up being a clunker like the Ascend.       I did some research on the brand, and discovered Huawei is a Chinese brand, and they are the world's 6th biggest manufacturer of cell phones. They have more market share than HTC, Sony, TCL, Blackberry, and Motorola, only slightly less than LG and ZTE, and 1/3 that of Apple. By the way, It's pronounced ""WAH-way"" and the 881C is a very nice phone. Don't be scared off by a brand you've never heard of. I am thinking most people will hear of them soon in the USA.    This is my 4th ST phone and my second android. My previous android was a low end LG. The experience with this phone is 3X better than the previous. So far it runs every ap smoothly, Runs Youtube videos without a glitch when signal is 2 bars or more (though there may be some buffering at the beginning). This phone runs on Verizon which is much better and faster in the area where I live, rural Michigan. I should have been on Verizon long ago.    The look and feel of this phone are quality. The 4"" display is beautiful and it's a good blend; big enough screen yet still small enough to fit in a pocket. It feels thin and sleek and not bulky. While I would not claim this to rival an I-phone it does have that look and feel and a similar experience. Compared to an iphone it's 500% cheaper and almost as good in my opinion. No brainer. For the $$ you will be hard pressed to find a better bang.    Do yourself a favor and buy a micro SD card immediately (well under $10). Then go into ""Settings, Storage, Default storage location"" and set the SD card as the default storage location for installed aps. This will prevent you from running out of memory quickly by installing too many aps, as there is not much extra internal memory.    The only area I would appreciate a little more performance is with the battery life. The phone has a 1750 mAh battery, which is big. However, battery performance is just average. Not a deal breaker, if you want a fancy phone with the bells and whistles this is the price you pay. Having a charger in the office or car to top it off is nice to have with this phone.    We shall see how this phone does over time. My LG developed lots of bugs and glitches after a while. So far this phone has exceeded expectations. If you want a great Android on ST through Verizon this phone will not dissapoint. I doubt there currently an ST phone that delivers more bang for the buck"

There are so many functions that it is somewhat complex. I am still learning to use the various functions.

19707	1	5	Y	Wireless	B00HUBO9V8	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Wireless Charging Case S View Flip Cover Folio - White (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Fantastic Buy!!!!	I chose to buy this case after having my Galaxy Note III for a week and a half with just a plain snap on case. I read through all the reviews on this, and never doubted once that I would have issues with this product. So I went ahead and purchased the White S View case from amazon, with amazon prime shipping. Received it today and I IMMEDIATLY fell in love with how durable the case looks, and feels on my phone. I was really impressed with how firmly it snapped onto the back of my phone. I was slightly skeptical about that, since the back that comes on the phone seems to be flimsy once removed. The  case stays firmly shut after being flipped open for certain periods of time with ease.  Like the phone, the features it presents when the case is closed on the S View screen are fluid and distinct. It has everything I would need when not looking at the phone with the case open. I would DEF recommend this to anyone with a new note III, or who are considering getting this. I work for a bank and constantly have tons of keys floating around in my purse, I no longer have to worry about any surface of my new Galaxy Note 3 getting scratched just by simply tossing my phone into my purse. And answering a phone call without having to open it? How awesome is that?<br />GREAT BUY! I would buy this again in a heart beat. Beats all other brands of cases I looked at getting. Samsung all the way.

16944	1	5	Y	Luggage	B00DHFJIBW	Travelon Anti-Theft Cross-Body Bag, Stone, Two Pocket	Worry free from pickpockets	I bought this for my trip to India.  It takes a bit of practice getting used to the clips as they are tight. I was glad I bought it. I felt more secure and didn't worry about pickpockets.  The size is smaller that I thought it would be, but it turned out to be just right. Not too big to draw attention and large enough to carry many odds and ends.  The beige color blended well with other colors. It's a very good purse to wear when in questionable places. Someone else on my tour had bought one as well.
11178	1	5	N	Toys	B00HXARJ6S	Trash Pack S6 Action Figure (12-Pack)	Trash pack series 6 are EGGcellent!	Series six rotten egg trashies are amazing!! They come hidden inside purple plastic eggs that pull apart at the side into two pieces. This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat. These new trash pack additions are very clever and detailed and were a serious hit with my son. Any trash pack collector will crack their shell over these!!
18142	1	5	Y	Apparel	B00FP462DK	TIEALIGN 5 Pack - Invisible Tie Stays Made in the U.S.A.	As close to a perfect solution as I have found	I was skeptical when I first saw them, and thought I would give it a try anyway.  It is an elegant solution (by that I mean understated, simple and exceeding expectations).  It holds my tie and the short end in place, is entirely invisible once applied.  It is also close to invisible on your dresser or desktop, so you need to know where you put them down.<br /><br />I am not overstating when I say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made from Amazon. For 30 years I have fought my ties separating into legs, wind blowing it into my face, tie dipping into the sink, and now all of that is a thing of the past.

Powerful light, not a battery hog, a clip that works, a light that tail-stands.  What's not to like.

11755	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B001TI0XRW	KONG Squeaker Tennis Balls, Large Dog Toy, 2-Pack	Insanity fun for big dogs	"We have 4 dogs, two who love the squeeker toys and two who are afraid of them.  My review is for Min. Schnauzer who is 11 but acts like she's 6 mo. when presented with a ""squeeker"" and my male black lab who spends hours and hours just laying and squeeking.  The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time.  I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it.  As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres.  The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us. We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun."

My Thinkpad X1 is getting old. I need another laptop and this one seems a perfect fit and a great deal. Everywhere I looked it costs $1100 or more. It is lighter than X1. The screen size is about the same. The look and feel is a little &#34;slicker&#34;. The touchpad is much larger. Yes it still has that famous red bottom. I love it. I rarely use the touchpad. The keys feel similar to X1. The touchpad feels somewhat different. It has almost all the accessories I need - 3 USB ports (instead of 2) and a SD slot. I think I'll end up using this T440S as my main computer and bump the X1 to a &#34;spare.&#34; This is only the first impressions. More user experience update later.

8187	0	3	N	Grocery	B0009F3POY	Traditional Medicinals Organic Motherâs Milk Tea, 16 Tea Bags (Pack of 6)	increased milk product but not without side effects	There is no doubt that this tea works wonders for increasing milk production. Within two days of drinking it 4-5 times a day I had more than enough milk. Actually my milk supply doubled! I am not a tea drinker so to me the taste is not very good. However increasing my milk supply is of course more important than the taste of the tea so if it didn't cause a terrible case of gas in my daughter than I would not have anything negative to say about it. But it made her so gassy that she did not sleep for almost an entire day.<br /><br />I suggest others to start with one or two bags per day to see if it has any negative side effects on your baby. I know it doesn't happen to everyone, I'm just one of the lucky one's I guess.<br /><br />I have since switched to taking fenugreek and blessed thistle capsules and I am again producing more milk than ever without any of the side effects the tea gave my daughter -[[ASIN:B00AAQIP5G Nature's Way Blessed Thistle (390mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsules]]. So, whatever it was that caused the gas in my baby, it doesn't appear to be the fenugreek or blessed thistle. I personally prefer the capsules anyways since I was not crazy about the flavor of this tea anyways.
13589	1	3	Y	Pet Products	B004ZJOH06	K&H Outdoor Kitty House, Heated	as he barely fits in it (hubby thought he would be fine in this one)	It really does not get that warm. I put a couple of towels in there for about 15 minutes to test it out, and it really felt no warmer than just the &#34;heat&#34; from the towels sitting there. We've been in the negative temps around here for the last week or two, and our cat will not even venture out to the porch, much less go in the house. Also, our cat is large - about 20 lbs. I should have ordered the larger house, as he barely fits in it (hubby thought he would be fine in this one). Having said all of that, he actually enjoys napping in the house - just not on exceptionally cold days...I could have bought him a much cheaper cat bed to nap on.
11029	1	5	Y	Camera	B005NX7HY6	Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras	Great for portraits and low light shots when a zoom is just too slow	I am a long time fan of Sony NEX cameras, and I have owned and used many of the Sony brand E-mount lenses available for the NEX cameras, including the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle, the SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS, and the SEL55210 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3. All those lenses have produced great pictures, especially when using RAW output corrected for distortion and chromatic aberrations through software such as Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom. When using the JPG mode the more recent NEX cameras, such as the NEX-5N and NEX-7, will, if the firmware has been updated, make a lot of those same corrections internally and automatically apply the corrections to the saved JPG images.<br /><br />The only draw back to the zoom lenses of course is that they are slow. Still, for low light level work, the use of a so-so slow lens with vibration stabilization will usually beat an optically  much better fast lens that does not support stabilization. So I was interested to try the Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8 for low light work. The extra lens speed allows for the use of a lower ISO, and the net gain in image qaulity is worth the cost to use of a fast lens.<br /><br />The lens has been great for work in low light, and the focal length has been perfect for close-ups of architectural details and art objects. If a photographer shoots in RAW, and uses Adobe Camera RAW or Lightroom to correct for lens distortions via software lens profiles, and to correct for chromatic aberration, or if the photographer shoots in JPG and uses the NEX camera's internal software corrections, then the few weak points of the lens are effectively canceled out. I have been very happy with my Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8, and plan to use it often on my next project. RECOMMENDED.

17068	1	3	Y	Home	B00KFT2ULI	5'X9.5' Military Flag Display Case Memorial with Personalized Brass Plaque and Frame Mat	Not Exactly What I Was Hoping For....	This display case is fairly attractive, but the quality of the workmanship isn't quite what I was hoping for, especially for the price I paid. The finish on the wood isn't completely even, and there is a small place on the front of the frame that shows where someone used a different shade of paint to cover up a flaw. Very disappointing. Also, it does not close tightly. The glass cover will shut, but it does not close air-tight. In fact, if the flag is not folded flat enough, the cover tends to pop open. I like the brass plate, and the engraving looks nice. In spite of the flaws, I decided to keep this because it had already been personalized and I wasn't sure a replacement would come out any better. The company who sells this was very professional and wrote me a nice email, thanking me for my purchase. I appreciate their conscientious customer service. But, the manufacturer of the frame could have created a better product with a little more effort.

Some people say the taste is not so good, but I don't think it tastes bad at all. I just mix it in a glass of water. It tastes fruity to me. I am so glad I found this product, can't wait to keep seeing the results with my hair. My nails have already grown fast on their own, so no problem there.

Product is excellent, although comes with absolutely any instructions, I went to u-tube to get video instructions, my Yamaha G16 Cart did not have a windshield, so I was starting from scratch. The ordering instructions say that this windshield is for the factory frame, but did not give the measurements, somewhere in the blogs I read 40.5 wide, and 36.25 high, if your frame has these measurements, as mine did, it should fit perfect, and yes it is easy to install once you see the video, or easier yet if you are replacing a existing windshield already on the cart. Comes with 5 mounting brackets that just clip onto the frame, the 2 large pieces fit on the side of the frame, pay attention to the 3 smaller pieces that fit on the bottom of the frame, the curved part of the windshield when folded down will rest on these.

Should you compete on Price or Quality of Services- within our Industry the customer may be driven only by Cost. If you allow that to be the only way to differentiate your Company from the Competitor, it can be very difficult to have profitable margins.

15491	1	4	Y	Video Games	B00320JDW6	Monster Rancher DS	Widly Addictive	The Monster Rancher Saga paired with mobility is the best thing you could ask for from UFO. I've had so much fun trying to raise all the different monsters, and pairing them trying to see which ones would combine in the right ways. My only complaint is that I wish there were maybe one or two other options of stuff to do with your monster. Other than that, it's a great time to be had. It's a good place to start with the series, and easy to just jump into. Whether you've played all of the Monster Rancher games, or none of them, this is a great purchase.

11560	1	5	N	Luggage	B00QGKFKU8	WODISON Transparent Clear Hanging Travel Toiletry Cosmetic Organizer Storage Bag Large	It holds a lot- airy compartment provided for toiletries that need it, easy to roll up and pack	Free product provided for evaluation and review. I received the pink version.  This organizer has a hanger that allows it to be hung up, or, if you want to roll it up, then the hanger turns in so that it forms a nice roll. It holds anything I'd need for a trip, and when it is hung up, it is very easy to see where everything is at a glance. It has nylon zippers and multiple sizes of compartments.  The very bottom has a net in case one needs to put something wet or that needs to air in the organizer.  It holds fairly large bottles and tubes.  There's one compartment that is long, and it is good for brushes and pencils.  The next row has 3 divided pockets and the top row has multiple small pockets.  It has belts around it, so that when you roll it up, you can belt it, which makes it very easy to put in a gym bag or suitcase. Really the only thing about it that I do not care for is the big WODISON logo across the top, but that's a minor thing.  Images pending.

16750	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B000HHQ70S	Kaytee Chew-Proof Water Bottle, 26-Ounce	It's always worked fine for me and my chinchilla	I'm glad I've owned two of these before buying it through Amazon, because the reviews on here are SCARY. People are talking about it falling on their animals, not dispensing water, leaking, etc. I even thought about not repurchasing, because of them, but then I thought to myself, &#34;that's crazy. Go with what YOU know.&#34; So I'm here to share my experience with this bottle.<br /><br />I have a five-year-old chinchilla living in a five-tiered wire cage with plastic tiers/bottom. I have the plastic, because he outgrew the curious stage and doesn't nibble/bite on anything (not power cords, not his cage, mainly just books when he's playing and of course his wooden chews inside his cage). Regardless, when I initially bought this, he WAS chewing on plastic, so I wanted something glass that could hang on his old cage, on the outside (I still hang this on the outside, because he does do a lot of jumping around, and I don't want him dislodging it).<br /><br />I don't use anything extra to secure the bottle. I use the coil only, and the bottom part rests in-between the wires. It's never once been knocked down. I had the smaller bottle at first, and it DID have issues dispensing water, but I always mark the water line with new bottles and check back within a few hours to see that it's significantly lower, so I knew right away of the issue. The person at Petsmart suggested the bigger bottle. It didn't have this issue. I could see the bubbles immediately when my chinchilla drank.<br /><br />After about a year, it started leaking. I think this is due to me fiddling too much with the pipe that dispenses the later (the part the animal drinks out of and the part that screws in are separate parts). I got a new one. And that's the one I've had ever since. I clean it with a pipe cleaner regularly and a mild soap/water solution, because the inside of the bottle can get a little gross, even if it's glass. That's precisely the reason I bought him a new bottle. The old one, after a fewyears, was just a little too gross.<br /><br />And this one works fine as well. So here are my suggestions after years of ownership:<br /><br />1. Buy the big bottle.<br />2. Still mark the water line with a sharpie or something to see that it goes down.<br />3. Clean the inside regularly.

A great help if you need to access all the boxes all the time.<br /><br />Great Plano quality too. The organizers are fine, the Only thing I may want is a stiffer more solid rack, as is , its flimsy, and the tie down used to ship them is way too tight, deforming the rack and will take some time and bending to get it back in shape.

5014	0	5	N	Kitchen	B00T7XWQ30	Avocado Slicer by Nature's Kitchen â Commercial Grade Stainless Steel	The OXO Good Grips 3-in-1 Avocado Slicer	The OXO Good Grips 3-in-1 Avocado Slicer, Green works very well as advertised.  It works well with this: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0088LR592/  The blade easily halves the avocado, making it equal to any sharp knife in the drawer. The pit remover is actually easier to use than a sharp knife - I've always slapped the knife blade into the seed & twisted, but then I have to pull the seed off the blade. I've never felt quite comfortable slamming a knife blade into the seed, or slicing the meat toward my hand -it goes against everything I was taught about cutting toward my skin with a sharp knife.   The Good Grips tool provides a much safer way to prepare avocados. I've owned several avocado slicers which had wire cutters, and the wires always sprung rending the tool useless. The slicing strips of the Good Grips slicer are sturdy plastic, cutting and scooping easily and cleanly through both large and small avocados.   On very ripe, soft avocado meat I've had to help the last little bit through the tool by pushing on the end of the avocado peel, but this is a minor thing. The tool fits comfortably in large or small hands; it certainly speeds up the preparation of avocados and is a clean way to prepare them; and it washes up easily. I'm glad I have it, and I recommend it.  I hope this review was helpful!

First, it is heavy and solid enough. When you use the extension tube and have put in three 26650 batteries, it feels like you are holding a baton in your hand, which gives you a sense of safety. Second, it is very bright. I live in the countryside. This flashlight can light up things within one hundred meters. Even the leaves on the trees can be clearly seen. That is really amazing. Third, I was worried about the quality of the batteries at first, but after using it on a daily basis, I found that its own 26650 batteries last for over two hours in highlight mode. This saves me a lot of bother, for example, always having to charge or take another set of batteries. I have really high demands, but I have to praise the fashionable and simple case, which suits my taste well. It could easily be given as a gift. I'd like to give it 5 stars .

11165	1	3	N	Kitchen	B00IWOJSAY	Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49983A Single Serve / Full Pot Coffee Maker	Lots of Room For Improvement	A decent coffee maker with lots of room for improvement.  It does K-cups, one cups, or a pot, but none of them well.    Pros    1. Flexibility - you can brew coffee by all three methods.  2. Price - This is cheap for what it is. (As long as you can get it for less than 70)  3. Size - It's not too large for what it does.  4. Programmable - Unexpected bonus at this price range.    Cons    1. Horrific plastic smell and taste.  It takes forever to get rid of it.  I had to run five full pots of White Vinegar and water to get rid of it.    2. One cups are horribly messy and tons of grounds make it into your coffee.  3. K-Cups are on the slow side, but not too bad.  4. You can only put in the water you want to use at that moment.  You cannot fill the basin and brew whatever you want. If you want a k-cup, you have to measure out the water.    Overall this is an okay coffee maker.  With some improvements it could be a great coffee maker.

It keeps going through frequent power outages during the windy season. It's become a valuable part of my morning routine even though I had to move it out of the bedroom.<br /><br />But that brings us to the cons: 1) The display is bright and can't be dimmed, which my husband loathed when he was trying to sleep. 2) The buttons make a very loud and jarring beep when you push them to set the alarm or change audio functions, and the beep can't be turned off. 3) I had hoped to use the clock as an MP3 player, but you can't shuffle the order of songs or use playlists; if you want to switch to more relaxing or upbeat music, your best bet is to have multiple thumb drives. 4) You'd think you could use the USB port to charge devices, but you can't. 5) The FM radio function is good, but when the radio is turned on, the display doesn't show the time.<br /><br />That said, I don't regret the purchase. I ended up putting this clock in the bathroom, where it functions very well as a night light; it also gets me going with news/music and keeps me on track in the mornings without the distraction of using a smart phone for those purposes. (You know: you go to turn on music and end up reading e-mail, checking apps, and so forth...) The no-frills, non-customizable nature of the interface keeps things simple. In that respect, it exceeded expectations and I'm actually pretty pleased with it!

11068	1	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B007OQV1TC	Backyard Basics 07216BB Small Grill Cover, 55-Inch by 20-Inch by 35-Inch	Generic Cover for BBQ Grills	[[VIDEOID:mo2EXBX4W2AWHSH]]This cover was purchased for a [[ASIN:B0007XXNT0 Meco Aussie 9329W Deluxe Electric Cart Grill with Rotisserie, Satin Black]].<br />The 'Aussie' branded one from their website was just too expensive when shipping was added.<br />Because the grill is in an area with high wind, I do take the extra precaution of tying it a bit more securely to accommodate it being slightly larger than my grill.<br />It's early in the season, but so far so good, even with the windy downpours here in the midwest. No problems with tearing, and it looks neat and tidy. Of course, if any issues arrive within the next few years, this review will be updated.<br />Any questions, or if you'd like to see a photo, just leave a comment and I'll try to assist. I hope this review helps!
11571	1	4	N	Electronics	B00KJGYRWW	iHome iBN27BX NFC Bluetooth Rechargeable Stereo Mini Speaker in Rubberized Finish, Black	Good sound, great value, but connectivity not quite as good as other devices	This speaker has excellent sound for the price. It is nice and clear with little distortion. The sound is nicely equalized, and there is plenty of volume even though the speaker lacks an independent volume control. (Volume must be adjusted via your device.)<br /><br />I have had few issues with connectivity, although my Motorola Droid sometimes does not play well with this device. (I have had no issues connecting my Droid to other bluetooth speakers and headphones.) While it does not connect with the ease of some speakers I have used, it is also not a major inconvenience. Sometimes I have had to try several times before it will connect.<br /><br />Battery life is decent, and this will work for half a day on a single charge using it at full volume.<br /><br />Bottom line: This unit has excellent sound for the price, but there are better options. For example, [[ASIN:B00IY3152C EtekcityÂ® Roverbeats T12 3.0+EDR Portable NFC Wireless Rechargeable Bluetooth Speaker With 3.5mm AUX Stero Audio, Enhanced Bass, up to 12 Hours Battery Life for Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, and Many More Devices Red]]
293	0	4	N	Video DVD	6304711905	Tombstone	Best Western Movie	I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha
18575	1	3	N	Outdoors	B000SL1AEG	Swagman Upright Roof Rack	flimsy but works with mods, price can't be beat	"This rack is far less sturdy than Thule or Yakima racks, but it does the job.  I have now traveled over 900 miles of interstate driving at 70+ mph with a bike on this rack and no issues.  It did seem to reduce gas mileage 1-2mpg. You just have to be sure to tighten the knob on the upright support before locking the key on it. I made a few modifications to improve stability. I added lockwashers to all the thumbwheel adjustment screw knobs, and I tightened the upright support with a 7/16"" wrench once in place.  Before placing the bike in the rack, I made sure the bike's brakes were applied by putting bungee cords around them to hold the bike so it couldn't roll forward/backward.  I used Hose clamps covered with foam pipe insulation to better secure the wheels in addition to the enclosed red nylon straps. After 3 years, the U-channel is bent all to hell but the rack still works. I only put the rack on the car when hauling a bike, because the powder coating is quite thin. I noticed light rust in places where the powder coating scratched off. I suspect if I kept it on the car all the time, it would rust alot more. The initial assembly is a pain.  I stripped a bolt, but extras were provided.  Once it is initially assembled, it is not difficult to install over and over to the factory roof bars of my 2011 Honda Element.  Just don't go through any Drive Thru windows or garages.  Total ground clearance was 9'6"" with a mountain bike atop my Honda Element.  The Aluminum Trek Mountain Bike I put on the rack has a very wide downtube and it was a challenge to open the vertical support wide enough, but I got it to work with some coaxing.  When assembling, make sure to install the vertical support with the lock facing the side of the car you want the rack on.  I think I could fit at least 3 or possibly 4 of these across the top of my Element."

10918	1	3	N	Video DVD	B009AJB0YM	10 Years	Watchable but also forgettable	Just what we needed is another high school reunion romantic comedy featuring mostly impossibly good looking former classmates, all with some hang-ups or dragged baggage.  The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.<br /><br />Channing Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.  Once there he finds his old high school sweetheart, Mary (Rosario Dawson) along with her new husband (Ron Livingston) in tow.  Then we have drunken party boy Cully (Chris Pratt) and his disapproving wife (Ari Graynor).  Also Lynn Collins as the former high school party girl, still trying to live up to that image, but with a secret.  Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.  One of the more interesting pairings is Oscar Isaac as Reeves who has become a famous pop star whose long ago crush on Elise (Kate Mara) has been reignited.<br /><br />If this all sounds all too formulaic, well it is.  On the other hand the performances are solid enough and there are enough chuckles and bubbling emotions to keep the audience interested for 90 minutes.  Watchable but also forgettable.
16138	1	3	Y	Camera	B005P99KSE	Wolverine PASS200 Handheld Portable Documents, Books and Photo Scanner	Wolverine PASS200 handheld scanner	"This is an ""O.K."" handheld scanner, but did not work as well as I had hoped.  It did work fine scanning 8 1/2 by 11 single documents that are laid on a flat surface, and would probably be fine to scan parts of pages.  Scanning entire pages from books - which is what I really wanted to use it for - did not produce results anywhere near as good.  I scanned as the manual recommended, but got blurry results about 40% of the time.  This was with the unit set to B&W scans at low resolution.  I don't think it was because I was moving the scanner too fast or not in a straight line.  I was scanning single pages from a book.  The photo on Amazon for the scanner shows it being used to scan two pages of a book with the center of the scanner passing along the middle of the binding (where the pages curve in).  I could almost guarantee that the scan in that case would produce blurred text about two inches in from where the pages curve in.<br /><br />I'll keep using it, and if I obtain better scans will adjust my rating.  But for now, I only give it a three-star rating."

We print a lot of contracts in the office here every day, The toner can save part of the cost of the original brand. The service from the seller it is good too. The cost is very low. Many guys may complain sth, but I feel it ok. Perhaps aftermarket toner cartridge is great.
19376	1	4	Y	Furniture	B0051HEDMI	Safavieh California Shag Collection SG151-1313 Beige Area Rug, 8 feet by 10 feet (8' x 10')	Quality rug at great price	Very nice rug. Thick and shaggy. I was hoping it would be a little softer based on some of the other reviews so I was a little disappointed in that regard. Don't get my wrong, it is still soft....but I'd felt others in this price range that were softer and that's what I was hoping I was getting. I didn't have any issues with smell as others reported. I added the Duo-Lock Reversible Felt and Rubber Non-Slip Rug Pad under this and it makes it even more comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, great quality rug for the price point.

2215	0	2	N	Watches	B002CVUO9M	Diplomat Single Burgundy Watch Winder with Built-In IC Timer	device stops for no reason	Everyday I find the device stopped for no reason. I simply unplug it from the wall power socket and then reconnect it so that it starts rotating. This happens everyday. I can't really tell how long it rotates before it stops. It's really frustrating though because 2 or 3 days later I find my watch stopped then I manually have to shake it and adjust date/time. This device looks good but cheap motor.

I like that it is a little short on the side so you have air flow and can peak in without disturbing baby.
15174	1	5	Y	Apparel	B008KCK2QW	Landing Leathers Men's Air Force A-2 Leather Flight Bomber Jacket - Black XXLT	Soft and Beautiful	Purchased this as a gift to replace my husband's jacket which wore out after 20 years.  This jacket is beautiful, soft, and has that irresistible leather smell.  I read the reviews about fit very carefully before choosing the size and ended up with a perfect fit.  This jacket looks great and goes with pretty much any look from grungy to dressy.  The lining is warmer than I expected, so it is definitely not a warmer-weather item.  I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
15190	1	5	Y	Video DVD	B00AFQSZB0	The Thief of Bagdad [Blu-ray]	Finally Perfected (Cohen Films Edition Blu-Ray)	My review is of the Cohen Films restoration of the Thief of Bagdad (Blu-Ray).<br /><br />If you're well versed on this movie or at least becoming aware, I can't stress enough how badly you need this version in your collection. Back in 1986 or 1987 PBS aired this movie a long with a adapted score by Carl Davis. From the different versions I've seen of this film, they'll attach Nikolai Rimsky Korsakoff's &#34;Sheherazade&#34; to the movie and call it a day. Carl Davis meticulously fitted the music of the same score to the scenes and added pieces of original music himself. It makes the film take on an entirely different character that leads to one of the most moving finales that I can remember. The restoration of the film is nothing short of wonderful picture quality wise, and the Carl Davis score is as complimentary as people remember it. It's worth every penny, get it while it's available.

Only one thing that concerns me is that I wore it all day Sat. and Sun. and when I took it off I did have some type of dark mark on my wrist so I'm hoping this won't happen all the time otherwise it'll make me think it was very cheap.
20842	1	1	Y	Home Entertainment	B003BWAKJA	Sylvania Portable DVD Player SDVD7027-C, 7-Inch, Swivel Screen, Black	AWFUL	We bought this for a road trip, are outside of our return window, and the VERY first time we used it, this past weekend, it skipped and restarted.  Good luck with the remote too - you have to be a yoga expert to control the thing.  The case doesn't fit it properly either, so if you hit a bump, the velcro won't hold it back and it'll flip forward.  I hate it.  I guess I'll be trying out the warranty, but guess what?  I replaced a Sylvania with this one, and that one also broke after a few months.  We follow installation instructions to the letter.  i thought this one might be different because of its decent reviews, but it was worse.  I suspect Sylvania paid for the good reviews on this item.<br /><br />EDIT:  Customer service on the warranty was awful.  AWFUL.  You have to pay to shipping and handling to return it, and $7 for them to return it to you.  And you get to speak with someone not in this country, who will make you repeat everything 150 times.  I'm not sure I'll be returning this, but I can guarantee I will not buy another Sylvania ANYTHING, nor will I buy electronics again on this web site.

Great product	This no bark collar works great! I used it on my puppy, who had to learn not to bark at inappropriate times, and she just needed to have it go off once and the barking issue was gone. Perfect!<br /><br />I like that it gives warnings, and that the shock starts off very low and gets increasingly greater, giving the dog the chance to get the concept without giving them more than they can handle.<br /><br />Would recommend this!

I saw this one here at Amazon and I liked its thickness right from the image displayed. I gave it a shot and I'm very satisfied with it. It's high quality and she really loves it. Thank you.

The 2 are so different I question where the screenwriters got their information and what they were doing when they wrote it.  I watched the movie with a confused and empty feeling as I watched them butcher a perfectly good story.  The book was read by all the kids in my daughter's school and they then had a family movie night.  All of the parents got up wondering what they had just watched.

This scale does everything perfectly. Kitty can sit or stand on the scale without a problem and it settles to the final reading quickly.

11775	1	4	N	Grocery	B007OSBEXI	Higgins and Burke Tea Capsules Green Tea Package compatible with Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 48 Count	Consistent	Green tea can be a bit tricky to get right, and forgetting to take it out at the right time can lead to a bitter/burned flavor.  Higgins and Burke green tea capsules bypass that issue by using a Keurig machine.  That means a consistent cup of green tea every time.  It is on the mild side and a bit gritty, but it is also good and relaxing.  With tea bags or loose leaf, the intensity and bitterness can be adjusted to preference, so I doubt that capsules will provide the ideal tea for any given person, but they are excellent for a consistent flavor that most people will enjoy.

AEON Mounts	Built tough	This mount is a beast and that's just what I needed for my huge display. I have a 90 some pound 70 inch and this mount holds it like its nothing. Now the mount is heavy and big itself so I guess that can be a draw back, but it has to be if your trying to get it to hold screens of this size and weight. It was pretty easy to install with a friend I would not recommend doing it alone it is a two man job. Once the we had it up and got my heavy tv on it everything held and didn't budge. When it came to moving it one of the joints were a little stiff just enough to bug me, I was able to adjust the swivel tension screw and fixed it with ease. This mount moves with ease as I change up the direction my display is facing all depends on where I am sitting or at in my room. But I can see the screen from a prefect angle wherever I wanted to be. I really have nothing bad to say about this mount just something's I pointed out. like I said you will need someone to help you because its heavy but other than that its smooth sailing. make sure your screwed into your studs! Great mount able to handle a large tv set with no problem.

She was really trying and was really persistent for 10 minutes straight. But then somehow it starts getting on he nerves and she is ready to through it into the wall. It's funny to watch her being so frustrated with... herself. But again, I think it makes her more patient with every try. She doesn't quit. Love that there are toys that develop those good qualities in kids.

I am always looking at ways to charge my phone or tablet without being connected to the wall or to the car.  This device is just the answer I have been looking for.  Small, portable, easy to charge and easy to use the SUPERPAK allows you the mobility that your phone or tablet at times does not allow.  I have tested its use on a couple of android devices phones and tablets.  It worked as advertised seemed to me it charged the devices just as fast as being connected to a wall outlet or the car.  I suppose the real question that I am curious about is whether it will maintain its ability over the long haul.  That is yet to be determined.  In the meantime I will enjoy the mobility the SUPERPAK allows me.  Highly recommended!
14431	1	1	Y	Pet Products	B006FRYOLI	Busy Dog Treats â Busy Bone, Busy Rollhide, Busy Chewnola, Busy Dental-PACK OF 6	Beware - Choking Hazard!	I have pit bulls who usually devour anything without a problem, but these rawhides made all 3 dogs sick.  One kept vomiting all night until pieces came up, and the other 2 were okay with it.  The next time I gave them to the other dogs who were ok with it only, and they both choked and gagged them up.  Don't know why, they have had rawhides like this before and they are not made in China, but I would definitely not buy them again.  They may be swallowing them too fast, but there is no way to stop that!  So beware!  I really was happy to find this product as it was priced nice, but would not risk it again.

I purchased this insert because it perfectly matched the upper and lower billett grills on my 2000 Mustang GT. I was very exited to install this grill so I went into my garage and........talk about a letdown. It is NOT an exact fit even though the product page on Amazon says it will fit my car. The problem is that the longest horizontal bar (they are not all the same length) is about 1/8 inch wider than the hood scoop on each side. Fortunately, I have a bench grinder and after a few minutes worth of grinding, it now fits inside the hood scoop as it should have to begin with. I gave it 4 stars because I am very happy with the look but not with the fact that it required modification.<br />P.S. My hood scoop is factory so I am puzzled as to the poor fitment.  The areas that are ground are hidden inside the scoop so they cannot be seen but care should be taken so as not to damage the polished surfaces. All in all, the look is great

So easy to use, comes out perfect every time.  I received these muffin forms to test and try in my own kitchen and I was so excited to try these, as soon as Fedex delivered them, I brought them in, washed them, and baked a batch of banana muffins. They baked up nicely, and quickly.    These silicone molds are oven safe to 450'. They are dishwasher, oven, freezer and microwave safe. I personally hand wash all my molds.    I love how versatile they are. You can use them for jello molds, ice molds, candy molds etc...The possibilities are endless. I love buying items like this that do more than just one thing.    These molds are easy to store, you can fold them, roll them of lay them flat, either way, they will retain their shape. I'm very impressed.  Heavy duty silicone and high quality!

I purchased because of the price and wanted to see how well it works. We start having issues right from the start with water pressure, but did not pay too much attention and changed to next filter when it was time, noticed  water pressure kept getting less and noticed our ice maker is making smaller ice cubes, had a tech come out and test everything and could not find a problem and we changed the filter with another of this Sypco and had little more water pressure but still not enough to make the full size ice and water still did not come out as it should. . I have contacted the tech support no response yet, I dont think I am going to bother purchasing this just again if they do not help. SO FAR IT SUCKS!.    I got call back from Sypco Tech Support within an hour of my call. They said they have changed manufactures and had some issue with WF294 and have a new one out and will be glad to replace ones purchased and to try and see the difference. I will be glad to upgrade my review again once I get the new ones and see if they are better.

Anyone wondering, I just cut the cord ran it threw a hole I made in my license plate light, sealed around the cord, once the wire is cut there's 3 more wires inside power, video, ground just reconnect the wires by color. Hooked power to the reverse lights and ran cords to my double din. Easy as that. Will update if I have any problems but so far its been freezing and snowy and rain and have not had a problem with it.<br /><br />Just a tip if water gets on the glass it may distort the picture a bit, just rub some rainx or wax on and it beads off nicely.<br /><br />Will update if anything happens, but really for $15 can't ask for more, let's just see if it will last.<br /><br />----------EDIT-----------<br /><br />Have been using this for about a year now and have not had any problems with it.  Picture is still very clear.  I have hand washed and used laser car washes and never had water leak into the camera.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to anyone that wants a easy to install back up camera.

Did NOT enjoy at all.  I do like the ease of simple ingredients you add when making & they are quick & easy to mix.  They did NOT raise much in the pan either.  It's wonderful that one bag makes TWO 8x8&#34; pans.  Fortunately, I only made one 8x8&#34; pan the first (& only) time I've made.  Next time I will try to figure out how much sugar to add for the half bag quantity of batter, & hope it tastes much better.  I tried sprinkling with powdered sugar to help sweeten it, but that just did NOT cut that bitter taste at all.  If anyone has experimented with this, please email me & let me know what you think!  Unfortunately, I ordered the 6 bag quantity from Amazon in order to get the best price.  Unwisely, I had never tried these before I purchased this large quantity (which I have never done before) but regrettably went by the many 5-star reviews.  There must be more people out there that enjoy the bitter tastes than I thought!

19999	1	3	Y	Apparel	B0058ZZ3X6	Lucky Brand Women's Vale Easy Rider Jean in Ol Sun Shower, Ol Sun Shower Wash, 31x32	Roomier jeans circa 1995	I got a size 12/31 which in my other Lucky Brand Zoe Bootcut jeans fit well. These were big around the waist which I was happy about because with Lucky Brand it can be hit or miss. I like them because they are much roomier and for women who have hips and thighs (like myself) the Easy Rider if they shrink will still look good. The price was great and I liked the subtle details on the back side. They are a faded circa 1995 sort of denim but they feel soft and I think they will survive many washings without completely fading. I have recently joined the Lucky Brand denim fad because through Amazon the jeans are much more affordable than at the Lucky brand store. $99 at the Lucky Brand store and their own website  is pretty high to pay for jeans especially in today's economy.

The game is survival, and the analytical skills needed to play the game makes this a good learning tool for the kids. I love the Settlers games and hope they make many more.

After a good deal of research and review reading I finally made my mind and bought this Key Power's battery and to be honest, so far it has been great. It gave me about 3 hours of unplugged power after 1st charge and cycle, and has actually improved in the 2 weeks since I got it.

11382	1	4	Y	Video Games	B003O6CB6S	Call of Duty: Ghosts - PC	It's awesome -- but don't expect to run it on your mom's 8-year-old Celeron notebook!	I really don't know what the reason is for all the hate for this game, but I think it's awesome.  However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.<br /><br />I've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.<br /><br />In regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.<br /><br />Edit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all.

I was looking for a wide brim hat for a beach vacation and ordered this one because it was offered with prime. When the hat came in a very small box I was concerned. I was hoping for a floppy brim hat with a bit of structure or wire along the brim. This hat is juat floppy with no structure to it. The size is nice, a bit large. I was hoping for an 8&#34; brim and this has a 10&#34; brim. It is hard for people to get close enough for pictures or to sit next to you but is nice if you are on the beach alone. I really wanted to love this hat but after two days out of the box and me playing with it, I still could not get the large crease line out of the brim and chose to return it. I went with another company and another hat in the end.

13966	1	5	N	Books	1502436736	The 3rd American Dream: That is Global in Reach	Inspiring, informative, practical. An essential for anybody with ambition.	As I read through Sharma's &#34;The 3rd American Dream,&#34; I found myself nodding at every page. His book - perhaps more aptly described as a treatise - is a masterful analysis of the past, present, and future of the elusive ideal we have come to know as &#34;The American Dream.&#34; His core message to ambitious Americans is clear: times are changing, and if we wish to seize the American Dream, we must all be prepared for it.<br /><br />Sharma himself mentions that the book - while age-independent - is tailored for younger generations. As a college student myself, I found his text to be surprisingly refreshing and accessible, considering the heavy topics it discusses. This was a welcome change of pace, since I was so accustomed to stale academic textbooks that spent far too much time discussing abstract theories, rather than synthesizing coherent lessons and offering practical advice.<br /><br />Indeed, &#34;The 3rd American Dream&#34; is a practical text. In Sharma's own words: &#34;You must have a vision - but remember - one lives by the day.&#34; It reads like a narrative while maintaining a solid focus on weaving together important topics to dispense valuable advice for entrepreneurs, students, investors - indeed all Americans with a goal in mind and the heart to pursue it.<br /><br />As a young American, I see the truth of Sharma's words DAILY resonating throughout our society. He discusses the unique, innovative atmosphere of the American people, the paradigm-shifting importance of the woman-operated enterprise as a vehicle for gender equality, the necessity for an infrastructure that facilitates the growth and development of future Americans, the various global superpowers (India, China, the USA, etc) and the industries they dominate, the various emerging trends in business...and so much more. And he never sacrifices depth for breadth; like a skilled diver, he plunges into each topic and surfaces with a new pearl of practical wisdom, backed by research andpersonal experience.<br /><br />This text is an essential read for any reader who understands the thrilling pursuit of the American dream. It equips readers with the historical knowledge they need to understand their place in history, the practical business knowledge they need to navigate the market place, and the motivational message that, if we take charge of our lives and make conscious, predictive decisions, we can realize the 3rd American Dream, turning the United States into - in Sharma's own words - &#34;the path to infinite prosperity.&#34;<br />Inspiring. A must-read. I highly recommend it.

1604	0	3	N	Video DVD	B0013F2ESM	Sex And Death 101	Winona Ryder is in it and that has to Count for Something	I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?<br /><br />Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.
10634	1	1	Y	Home Entertainment	B005MR6CNK	Sony SMP-N200 Streaming Media Player with Wi-Fi	No Subtitle Support	I read some of the reviews and decided that this is the streaming player for which I have been searching. I bought it and set it up with no problem. However, to fully enjoy a movie I need subtitles. This player, to my utmost surprise, does not support subtitles. I cannot use it and that is the reason for my one star rating.<br /><br />If you are interested in this item I suggest you read the review by Jean Luc, which I unfortunately failed to do prior to the purchase. This is the most comprehensive and informative review I have seen. It will be a majorr aid in your decision as to making the purchase. This review lists the numerous pros and cons and if I had read it I would not have purchased this item because lack of subtitle/CC support is identified. If you don''t need subtitles then this may be the player for you. One big plus is that it does not require a credit card to start off with such as the Roku 2 XS 1080P does. I tried the Roku and it was so bad I had to send it back. I wil keep the Sony in hopes that a subtitle upgrade is in the future. Wishful thinking, I know.

Obviously every picker has preferences for relative thickness (I like a slightly lighter fingerpick for banjo) but for all-around utility, this is a good price for a good product.  And I like to keep a few extras around for a pickin' friend who might have forgotten to pack a few in their pocket...The tube is a handy way to keep it together.

After reading number of reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase wash mitts from Crusar due to their good elastic wrists and pretty good size. I was really impressed with their shipping timings and nice packaging. These wash mitts are perfectly fit for my hands. These microfiber mitten has longer fibre fingers and therefore has more ability to absorb waters.  These mitts are also great for other purposes like dusting of delicate objects, electronics and even soaking wet dogs after a bath. Overall, the products are very good so far and worth caring for. I would surely like to recommend for all washing and drying purpose.

10962	1	4	N	Electronics	B00DDPZ4FA	MEE audio Sport-Fi M6P Memory Wire In-Ear Headphones with Microphone, Remote, and Universal Volume Control (Black)	Good Headphones Especially for the Price	"Although I'm not an audiophile, over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to use and try several different types of headphones. Recently, I had the opportunity to use and try the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EAR HEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL.  For the retail price these headphones sell for, they are an incredible good buy. I've had some headphones that cost around $150 and the MEE ELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6-P HEADPHONES are just as good in sound quality as those.<br /><br />These headphones are more like earbuds since they actually go inside one's ear instead of over them. However, unlike some other earbuds I've used, these hurt my ears after extended use.  Each part of the headphone is designed for a particular ear: one piece has a small ""R"" for the right side of one's head while the other is marked with a ""L"" for the left side of one's head.  The design of the earbuds also makes them good for exercise. However, as I've only used them while briskly walking, I can't say for sure how they will do while running or doing more strenuous exercise. However, the headphones do come equipped with a small clip (like a microphone clip) that can clip on to a piece of clothing.<br /><br /> In terms of aesthetics, I don't like the look of these headphones. It's not a terrible design, but even in the black color I just don't find them as visually pleasing as other headphones I've used and seen.<br /><br />While listening to music are a video with the headphones on, the sound doesn't escape the headphones unless the volume is turned up extremely high. Also, although they aren't designed as ear plugs, the headphones also work rather well at keeping most outside noises out.<br /><br />These headphones are also equipped with a microphone and volume control. I have not used these headphones as a microphone so I can't say how they function in that capacity.<br /><br />Overall, the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EARHEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL are a good set of headphones for the price."

Since we can't return this at this point, we are making appropriate changes to adapt it for the two new birds.

12779	1	5	Y	Tools	B00G0ORQIE	Vaughan 569-56 BS150D Bear Hand Saw with Fine/Extra Fine Blade, 5-1/2-Inch	Get one.	If you've never owned a nice draw saw like this one ...you should. I have three of them. This little beauty has a two-sided blade: one side with fine teeth and one side with finer teeth.<br /><br />Once you own one of these draw saws you'll wonder how you survived so long without one. These saws excel at fine, delicate and exacting cuts. The blades are thin and flexible. They also make a great saw for cutting PVC pipe or back cutting the door moldings when installing laminate flooring. And I could go on. But won't. So buy one of these. You'll find out. Vaughn makes nice ones; this is my second Vaughn saw. The saw is made in Japan which is where draw saws were invented. In the right hands you can cut dovetail joints with these saws ...mine, however, are not the right hands.

Now that she's one it still seems to be one of her favorite play things! I've bought other toys for her since but her Octoplush is always right beside her in the crib whenever she goes to sleep and now she even dances a little bit when she hears the music! I assume she'll have it to enjoy for quite a few more years. It was a great buy and fairly inexpensive! A wonderful first toy for babies.

It is very  sturdy - absolutely no wobbling - and as another reviewer said the legs are real wood, not veneer.  I was a little worried that the espresso color would be too dark, but it's quite lovely and has some vague red tones, almost like a mahogany - even came with a touch-up pen.  I could not be more pleased, especially for only $155!  I highly recommend this product.

The remote is easy to use, and the speaker itself blends in well with the room I have it located.  My one complaint is that my iPod (2nd generation) doesn't charge in the station, and I have to hook it up through the auxiliary line.

Not sure why such a key area of the watch and the most stressed part of it would be plastic. Not recommended.

Hi All,<br /><br />This will be quick and smooth. This isn't the best bluetooth receiver I've ever used, but the customer service I received knocks this to five stars. Be careful with the ear buds, they are easily lost and fall off. And that's where the customer service comes in. I lost all of my ear buds: they would fall off when the headset was clipped to my shirt, just lying around, etc.<br /><br />I emailed customer service and was sent four new buds plus another little pouch for the headset. Cool huh? Other than that, this is a serviceable headset (for the price) that picks up well and seems to cancel outside noise well, too.

I thought it was cool, but then I got it and was really disappointed. This is not a bike you take out on a mountain trail and expect to come back in one piece.
2102	0	3	N	Outdoors	B00ASSQYK4	Allen Sports Deluxe 2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack	Interesting design	I have to admit that the design of this trunk mount rack is at least interesting. First time, I just couldn't believe that it is able to hold 2 bikes. But, yes...it does.<br />In my opinion, the greatest advantage of this trunk mount rack is that it keeps the bikes behind the car and not on top of it, so it you don't have to put too much effort when mounting the bikes. Unfortunately, some effort is required...because my wife wouldn't be able to mount them by herself.<br />The straps are a bit insecure. They could start loosen when driving at higher speeds, so you have to check them once in a while. I don't think that they will loosen completely but it's better to stay on the safer side.

Just got one of this product and its pretty cool for me since traveling is my hobby. The 5 gallon water carrier has spigot cap for easy filling and dispensing, which makes it easier for me to fill without spilling.  The handles are strong enough to carry 5 gallons of water , when empty it could be packed easily as like to some piece of cloth because it's flat foldable and able to be compressed into a smaller  form. Great for camping and fishing trips, no more bulky gallons to carry.

I try to rotate my shoes, but sometimes I cannot.... I spray it on my shoes in the evening before going to bed, the next morning my shoes smell fresh and I can wear them again, without worries to get embarrassed.
12386	1	5	Y	Luggage	B005FOJD9K	Totes Blue Line  Golf-Size Vented Canopy Compact Umbrella, Navy/White, One Size	Sturdy, larger collapsable umbrella	I am sick of disposable umbrellas.  I wanted a sturdy umbrella that would hold up to wind and I could tuck into my briefcase.  This is more convenient than a traditional golf umbrella in that it collapses, but as previous reviewers have commented it is on the large size.  I have a nylon briefcase/bag and this does fit in it, but not discretely--it projects out the top.  However, as I travel by foot among several buildings this is useful to have available.  I am willing to trade length for functionality (the extra panel for wind) .  I wear glasses and absolutely detest getting water on them, hence the desire for an umbrella (I never know when a rain shower will pop up).  Also the pattern (blue and white) makes it obvious, which is helpful in the dark or reduced visibility situations. I was once almost hit by a car while in a cross walk because I was wearing a dark coat and they just didn't see me.

On the other hand it doesn't seem to hurt her, but is enough of a negative reinforcement to allow me to control her.  I tried knock offs of these but this brand is superior.

I gave it a bit of a hit on the durable area because it does come with a small key that you can use to lock the register that I am sure will get lost quickly but over all it a strong product that takes a bit of a beating from my 3 girls. They are some tough cashers! A little loud but the girls love it. If you are looking for a register this is a must buy.

Instead I found someone who is boring, just like my teacher. Maybe he makes good points, or different points than my teacher.<br /><br />But he's still boring. I hope this is not unfair. I'm sure it's a great book if you like boring things. I don't.

15879	1	4	N	Home	B001RCUNOI	Sterilite 28308002 3 Drawer Cart, White Frame with Clear Drawers and Black Casters, 2-Pack	Great But the Wheels Will Traumatize You!	I love that these carts come fully-assembled (except those %&*$# wheels - see below) and all you have to do is peel the little piece of scotch tape off each drawer meant to hold them in place for shipping, and hope it comes off in one piece and you're not reliving bad tape experiences from x-mas.  They are such a convenient size to store practically anywhere.    Then came the wheels that made me a different person....  in a bad way...    It seems so simple.  Push each wheel into each hole on the bottom.  Oh my lord.  I pushed, jiggled, shimmied, murked, rocked, crunked, wiggled, grinded, twerked, got jiggy and did the Macarena to try to get a wheel in a hole and it took years off my life.  For the love of Jesus, Sterilite, can you make the holes just a tiny bit bigger or lower the endowment of those wheel pegs???    Once you do get them in, they still don't look like they're fully in, but it's ok, because by then you don't care and you're at a point mentally where you surrender to a Higher Power, and thus find peace.  In fact, I found God because of these wheels!    Once you flip it over it rolls great.  You may even have to run after it and catch it, such as on hardwood.  But it's also a great way to find out if your floors are level!  Thanks, Sterilite!

They arrived and I immediately put them on the seats in my car. They were so easy to put on and I can already see marks on them from where the kids kick them with their dirty feet! The nice part it being able to wipe them off with just a simple damp rag! I definitely recommend these Kick Mats from Kiddleco for anyone who has kids!

On your wrist it will pass the test for most occasions. On very close inspection, it will not pass as the original 40's watch because of the detailing on the face. It is good enough though for a attractive watch. I won't belittle the movement because having many antique watches, if you wear everyday you know how old movements are affected by everything.

12586	1	4	Y	Home Improvement	B0016FZL48	SentrySafe 1100 1/2 Hour FIRE-SAFE Chest, 0.18 Cubic Feet, Dove Gray	Perfect for condo use.	I needed a place to put things I always seem to tuck somewhere else and can never find later -- passport, SSN card, birth certificate, car titles. Nothing financial or valuable like money, jewelry or stocks, etc, I just need something I can grab or find if a fire ever happens. Also put some family pics and odds and ends in it.  This chest is definitely better than the drawers and tuckaway spots I had been using.  I don't need Fort Knox, and I don't store ammo in it like another reviewer, or plan to drop it off a table, like another reviewer did.  I just slide it under the bed and know that I'm better off with this than I was before I bought it.

I was worried that in not seeing this backpack in person, it would be a little &#34;cheap.&#34; But I was wrong. It seems very well made and will hold up just as good as any less expensive pack. My daughter loves it and as I get in and out of it every day, it seems very strong and well made.

15480	1	4	Y	Musical Instruments	B002MA5LGE	Vento 901-VE5305I 500 Series Curved Soprano Saxophone	Not professional quality, but perfect for my level and it was on sale!	I am a hobbyist saxophone player, playing in a couple of community bands and solo at nursing and assisted living homes, so I do not need a professional level instrument. The day I bought this it was on a special sale and was under $300. Tone quality is fine, but tuning has been a slight problem as it required the mouthpiece to be pushed almost the entire length of the cork before in tune. I also initially had a problem with several sticky pads, but after nearly two weeks of treatment and cleaning, that was resolved. Overall, it was a great buy for a very good horn for an amateur hobbyist sax player.

PERFECT!!!! If your looking for a great backpacking bottle, or just a great all around NON LEAKING bottle, that wont poison you with lead, or other harmful contaminants found in competitors water bottles...this is without a doubt for you!!! Took backpacking to the Devils Den in Arkansas, no regrets!! Also notable: my water filter screws right onto these bottles! This made the usual tedious choir of pumping spring water almost fun!! These bottles are light weight, and very durable. These are NOT vacuum, double walled bottles, but extended cool/hot time frames, and sweating are not a factor for me!!! Great buy!
5660	0	5	N	Home	B004KNOYZK	Bad Ash 2 Fireplace & Stove Vacuum Cleaning System	An Excellent Fireplace Vacuum	Before stumbling upon the Bad Ash 2 (love the name btw) I actually ruined my expensive home vacuum. Even though the debris I was picking up was cold, the vacuum repair guy mentioned that the fine particles just weren't designed to be picked up by a household item and generally clogged up the motor. That's when he suggested I try I vacuum specifically designed for ash and debris pickup. After some research I came across the Bad Ash 2. I tried it and it did an excellent job. If you have a fireplace or are looking for a faster alternative to scooping up your ash with a broom and dust pan, I would highly recommend the Bad Ash 2.

The material is very soft and the print looks good. To remedy the problem we placed a 10x20 black backdrop behind this one and it looked as if my wife was pretty far in front of the wall and it made a corner into a darker room. Raising it up high enough for a standing person brought the floor up higher but due to the prop behind my wife it did make it look as if the wall was further back.
16048	1	4	Y	Electronics	B004OA733E	iHome iM60LT Rechargeable Mini Speaker - Gray Translucent	Its a good product that does its job well	Its a good product that does its job well. When connected at full volume the audio is very loud which is great for those who need it. Sound quality is average, good but not amazing. But that's what you can expect with a price this low.<br /><br />I would recommend that you open up the speakers (to expose the spring like white plastic) very sparingly. Since that is made of thin plastic it tends to rip pretty easily, pretty soon all of it would be ripped and the only thing connecting the bottom and top half would be a couple of wires. This happened to me within a month or so, but I did use it everyday. Opening up only gives you slightly more bass and I personally feel that its not so great sounding that it would warrant you risking breaking it.<br /><br />Aside from that it still works great and I have had for about a year. I have not upgraded to bluetooth speakers so I don't have much use for it but for this price its a great item.

This is by far the best mustard both for sandwiches as for cooking (salmon, mussels, scallops). Last resort: Amazon. Thank u very much.

Bought to do bed lighting in my truck. Works really well, easy to trim to length. The adhesive does not hold up well at all especially of left in the heat. Applied a bead of silicone adhesive under it and holds up very well. They are plenty bright for my application but not super bright. Leaves kind of a blue/purple light, not bright white.

It's good to now be able to run without having to keep putting my ear plugs in my ear. I've even slept in these.  Great product and great price.

I really am surprised by some of the reviews when you consider how cheap the watch is, for the price you pay this is excellent. It has all the regular watch features you would find in a more expensive watch such as a daily alarm, hourly chime, EL backlight, unidirectional bezel, dual time display, timer, and date function.<br /><br />It does also come in a variety of colours which is something that cannot be said of its expensive counterparts. These watches are supposed to be imitations of much more expensive watches and they do a god job, they are fashionable and sturdy.<br /><br />If you are after a perfect watch then this not the watch for you, however, if you are after a stylish and affordable watch that really looks the part then this is the one for you.

Even the ones that are supposed to hook around your ears didn't fit. I have always had to use over the ear bulky headphones. I saw this product and took a chance. They are FANTASTIC! Not only did they stay in my ears, I can even cycle with them! Sound quality is really good too! I may buy an extra set - one for work and one for home!

Playback was smooth, the menu/remote takes a little time to figure out but it is functional.  I did have a problem with photos that were too tall to fit on the screen (&#62;768px) but not as wide as the screen (&#60;1368px) not being displayed correctly, whether in &#34;original&#34; or &#34;optimized&#34; mode.  That's not a big deal for me because I just resized all of the problem images and they displayed correctly.  This frame was a gift for my grandmother's 100th birthday and its only job is to circulate pictures whenever she is in the room so it is perfect for that task.

I put them out at the beginning of October and keep them until after Thanksgiving.  They are a perfect size - not too large so they take up too much space but not so small that they aren't noticeable.  You can display them in a group - I put mine on my fireplace hearth - or individually throughout the house.  You can even display them in a cornucopia.  You can display them inside or outside the house.  I've done both but like to keep them inside as they are so realistic looking that squirrels stole them from my front steps!

I've used it twice a day on my face and back for the last month and even from after a couple of days use my skin immediately started clearing up and just kept getting better. I use it with a gentle organic cleanser and my skin is almost flawless. What imperfections still come is a shadow of what i used to get and disappear almost without notice. I would HIGHLY recommend this product, total game changer
2308	0	3	N	Outdoors	B00CULFR4Q	Xtreme Bright LED Bike Light and Bike Taillight FREE TAILLIGHT 100% Through Triumph Innovations Only	Kudos	I bought this bike headlight from another online vendor and was greatly anticipating its arrival. The light only took 2 maybe 3 days to get here but it did not work. The box itself looks like it had taken quite a beating during shipping, so this may have lead to my light not working, I can't be sure. But the online vendor I bought it from did not respond to my requests for a refund. I eventually found the manufacturer here on amazon and just as a last ditch effort sent them a message explaining my plight. To my surprise I received a phone call from a  real live human being the next day! He was extremely congenial and apologized for my recent experience and assured me I had either received a defective unit or that it was indeed damaged on its way to me. He offered to replace it with no further questions and I was really surprised - needless to say I can't rate the headlight itself yet, but I wanted to post SOMETHING now and once I get the replacement I will update my review. Kudos to a company that still displays a little old fashioned customer service.

When I ordered this I was not 100% sure what I was getting. Once it arrived my GF looked at it, played around with the different configurations and said &#34;Wow. That's a great idea.&#34; I have to agree.<br /><br />Configuration 1: Cake/dessert tray/display. Keeps pastries and the like moist and fresh, and you can see them/it. The dome is large - about 4.5x10&#34;, so it will fit most cakes. Since the entire thing is clear plastic, you really don't want to slice into it. I'd suggest a cardboard disc under whatever you wish to cut.<br /><br />Configuration 2: Simply remove the dome and flip over the base. Now you have a snack tray with bowl for dip. The bowl is removable so you can use your own.<br /><br />Configuration 3: Same as #2, but put the dome over it. Also the most compact storage option.<br /><br />Lots of uses, great for parties. We already used it for two holiday gatherings. It's also very stable and looks great.

17517	1	4	Y	Beauty	B001W2K51O	J.R. Liggett Bar Shampoo, Jojoba and Peppermint, 3.5 Ounce	Hard water disclaimer...	The first few times I tried it, my hair was covered in tacky film. Rinsing with vinegar did not work. However, I followed the hard water tips on Liggett's website, putting a little baking soda in a large tupperware and filling that with warm water and using that to saturate my dry hair in the shower and it has worked just fine since. You can use regular water for competing the lather and rinsing. Worked well as is in NYC and VA. I think the bar has best results when your hair has more natural oils in it, so I've been brushing with a boar bristle brush to distribute oils at night and before washing. Have been able to stretch out time between shampoos to a few days rather than every other.

Was not happy because now we can't use it or return it. Thought the quality could have been a little bit better. Also, it only came with one window valace, most rooms have two windows do they not?

6566	0	5	N	Sports	B0007IS74G	AB WHEEL	Ab Wheel - Highly Recommend	I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use.<br /><br />I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need.<br /><br />On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called [[ASIN:B00GA200WU Raspberry Ketones ]] which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.

11774	1	3	N	PC	B007FPIP6Y	Belkin Pro Tri-Fold Folio Case / Cover with Stand for Apple iPad with Retina Display (4th Generation) & iPad 3 (Black)	Not bad, but not versatile. Read for my recommended model instead.	I've tried several different holders for my iPad 2. I really like the Belkin models and especially like the Cinema Dot Folio that I'm currently using. I've tried this Tri-Fold model, but really didn't care for the foldable cover. It folds into a small triangle and props the iPad to either a very steep or very flat angle and nothing in between. It has the auto-wake magnets which automatically turn your iPad on when you open and off when you close...very cool and works really well on all the Belkin's I've tried.<br /><br />My version of the Belkin iPad2  holder (btw, it works with the iPad3 too) has a variable angle prop/cover and I LOVE it!!! Here's the link to mine, on sale for $33 (list $50) it's a great buy:<br />[[ASIN:B007FPISNE Belkin Cinema Dot Folio with Stand for New Apple iPad 2 / 3rd Generation, HD, 1080P, WiFi, 4G LTE, AT & T, Verizon (Black/Grey)]]<br /><br />There is a newer version of mine, but $50...is quite a bit more. It has a slightly different outside cover, but basically the same. (Both clean-up really well with a wet sponge):<br />[[ASIN:B007FPIQ72 Belkin Cinema Folio with Stand for New Apple iPad 3rd Generation, HD, 1080P, WiFi, 4G LTE, AT & T, Verizon (Black/Black)]]<br /><br />This tri-fold cover's current price of $28 is pretty good over the list price of $40, but I would definitely recommend the $33 model I've listed above.

14867	1	4	N	Baby	B004854WM0	phil&teds Lobster Highchair, Black	Works well but has a few flaws	The lobster has worked well for us but could be better with a few changes. As others have mentioned, it does come with a tray. It was useful for awhile but now that the baby can pick it up and throw it, the tray has been relagated to storage. The other change I would make is that there doesn't seem to be a good way to clean the seat. Wiping it down hasn't been totally effective and it isn't detachable so I can't put it in the wash. Overall it was a good purchase but I would probably purchase another seat.

I got this for the extra battery life. I'm not a big fan of slim cases for protection. I'm really hard on my phone. Works great for prolonging the battery life. Works exactly as advertised as far as that goes. I would recommend it to a friend without hesitation. If you're looking for protection, this is not the best case for you. If you want extra power, this is perfect. One star deducted because of the protection issue, but I knew that when purchased it.

We've found its a bit difficult to grasp it, and when we do grasp it (if it's fresh) it does tend to dirty the scooper (although that would probably be a problem for any scooper).

After the first use the spring broke on the peeler ring. I am still able to use the product it just doesn't spring back to take off the whole peel.<br /><br />I also wish the silver counter hook was mounted on the other side of the peeler. It does not hook to the counter the way it was designed.<br /><br />It was very east to install the handle just need a phillips head screw driver.

16219	1	4	Y	Electronics	B004264PT0	Monoprice 107112 4x2 True HDMI Matrix Switch with Analog Audio Output	Close but not quite perfect	I have a first generation Sony LCD HDTV that only has DVI input. This hasn't been a problem until I bought a Roku 3, which only has HDMI out. DVI doesn't accept HDMI audio, so I needed a solution that could accept HDMI input and output both video and analog audio. Enter this unit, a 4x2 switch with analog audio output. It works great, saved me from needing to buy a new TV.<br /><br />However, there's a glitch. If I turn on the Roku after I turn on the Monoprice, I get a 'restricted content' message and only the audio works -- no video. If I turn off the switch for 15 or so seconds and turn it back on after the Roku's been started, everything is fine. Hence the 4 start review, it does the job, it does have a minor annoyance.

15969	1	3	Y	Grocery	B003SC0Q4C	Blue Sky Zero Calorie Stevia Soda (Jamaican Ginger Ale, 12-Ounce Cans, Pack of 24)	I don't hate it but I won't buy it again...	I purchased this in hopes of replacing gosling's ginger beer (YUM) for making my moscow mules to lower the sugar and calories I was consuming. I was happy to find a diet soda that might be able to fit the bill. I've had other jamaican ginger ale (Reed's is delicious but expensive). For the price I decided to just give it a shot. The delivery was super fast and came in perfect shape. The first flavor I taste is super gingery (which I love) but the aftertaste is a musky kind of bitter taste I can't put my finger on (maybe the stevia?) and I don't like it. I've been mixing this soda half and half with diet ginger ale from my soda stream (which is good but not gingery enough for me) for my cocktails but will have to keep searching for a diet ginger beer that can replace my high sugar favorite! :(  Please let me know if any of you have suggestions! :)

16834	1	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B002EPF6YO	VIZIO VSB200 Universal HD Sound Bar (Discontinued)	Painless setup, great sound.	I bought this unit in December 2012 as a Christmas present for my partner. In considering my options, I first opted for an LG sound bar to match the LG TV I would be pairing this with, but after reading the dismal reviews for available LG bars, I branched out for other options. I landed on this one purely by chance, clicked it because of the minimally intrusive design, and skipped right to Customer Reviews since manufacturers like to puff up their products (LG...).<br /><br />So I started reading the reviews, and time after time for the first 40ish, everybody had generally positive things to say. Sure, there was the incomprehensible setup/manual, but I figured &#34;I'm savvy enough I can figure it out.&#34; So I ordered it. Selected standard shipping. Expected to wait about a week and a half. Tick tock. I'm allowing myself to be excited by now.<br /><br />FOUR DAYS LATER, it's here! Oh boy oh boy oh boy! The box is long (about 4.5 feet) but somehow managed to arrive without any crushed corners or gashes. I drag it inside, set the whole package on the cocktail table in front of me and sit like a lonely, excited puppy and wait for my partner to get home. It's technically his, after all.<br /><br />He walks in, sees the long new box and his face lights up just like mine did, maybe brighter because I somehow managed to keep it a secret. Tears into it, pulls everything out of the plastic bags and puts the feet on it. Sets it in front of the TV (it's a 46&#34; and it all but lines up perfectly with it). Stares at me because he's never used a TOSLink cable... Well, neither had I so I flipped thru the book as fast as I could and 4 pages later I'm at the end with no answers. Maddeningly unhelpful! I look at the cable and match the shapes on each end, one to the bar and one to the screen. It doesn't go in! Ohhh, don't forget to pop the plastic tips off your new TOSLink connectors before you try to plug them in.<br /><br />So now we're all set up. It's connected to the TV, it's plugged in, it's ready to go. Power! Lights flashing! And...no sound. Hmm. Tap the remote on the table because that's the solve-all. Point it at the bar. Yep, it works, the lights are back. (They're white and blue, the two brightest LED colors, so they automatically turn off to mitigate glare.) I press Input on the bar's remote. Then again. And WHOA. Ear angels sing. TOSLink is Input 3, everybody. You'll need to know that, the book doesn't cover it.<br /><br />The whole setup process from unpacking to ear ecstasy took less than half an hour with no instructions and just a touch of common sense. Totally painless.<br /><br />A week later we wanted to mount it on the wall. It's literally as easy as flipping the feet and hooking it on the screws you put in the wall 3 minutes before. Again, painless.<br /><br />A few notes. It should've had Bluetooth. Turn on and then leave on &#34;SRS.&#34; It's comparable to the effect of removing earplugs with the law mower running: the sound is SO MUCH clearer, brighter. Don't bother with &#34;TVol,&#34; it seems to muffle sound more than it levels output volumes. Some of the reviews say the remote has limited range; ours works wonderfully from 15 feet away and from the sideways end of the sectional. Mount it on the wall so it's high enough to catch your remote's suggestions. And be careful when lugging it around: during our recent move it collided with a wall on one end and the stainless plate (actually plastic) jumped off and one of the prongs on the plate snapped off inside of the hole in the body. Nothing a dab of Gorilla Glue can't fix and it's really a well-built item, just don't abuse it.<br /><br />Am I happy with this? Yes. I'm on here to buy two more. I absolutely recommend it, highly. It outperforms a high-end 5.1 system. It's less than $100. GET ONE!

I like how it comes with a multitude of attachments and it can be physically mounted permanently. I am going to purchase several more so I never have any dead batteries on my toys again!!!

Fitment perfect for a 1999 k1500 Suburban bolted right on in 20 minutes.<br /><br />Truck rides a little firmer now, ride height looks the same to me. I'm very happy with the results, truck rides well.
15387	1	2	Y	Furniture	B00275EWJ6	Celtic Bakers Rack - Gunmetal Gray	Poor manufacturing - unstable and unable to fully assemble with provided hardware	This item looks nice enough but my model is unstable (rocks back and forth when on a level, non-carpeted surface) and two of the holes that support one of the shelves were not large enough for the provided screws.  I needed a taller section for my orchids (using this as a plant shelf) so we just left that shelf out but I'm now concerned about the stability since its one of the bottom shelves that I planned to put something heavier on to weigh it down.  Long story short, this would be nice if the manufacturing was more precise.

It doesn't fit the tires of any of my bikes and nearly bent the spokes. Good thing I noticed the damage before it got serious.
20101	1	2	Y	Apparel	B005L9ZN0M	Del Rossa Microfleece Footed Pajamas, Black, Small (A0320BLKSM)	Less than 3 hours!	Literally just got these in today, the quality of the body is okay so far, but the heel of one of the feet just blew out less than 3 hours after I've worn it. My feet are not large, they don't even fill out these feet, and the heel is already broken. It's warm, but I'm gonna have to take to fixing this and if I have any more problems within the next few days this thing is going back no questions.
7270	0	5	N	Grocery	B001ELL9GI	Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Nibs, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)	Addicted!	I love these! I love chocolate but am cutting back on sugar. I make a morning chocolate smoothie with these, add them to my pumpkin bread and banana bread, and cut back on chocolate chips in my chocolate chip cookies by replacing some of them with these. The flavor is outstanding and the Navitas brand always tastes very fresh.
18384	1	5	Y	Electronics	B00LU0GPAI	Onkyo HT-S3700 5.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver/Speaker Package	Big sound, not too much money	We use it in our media room which is about 16x17 and enclosed and the sound is tremendous.  Plenty of volume and so far it has not shifted into &#34;protect&#34; mode from being too loud.  We have had that experience with our previous units and that is very frustrating.  Apparently we like to watch movies quite loudly.<br />We only have used it for movies and and it has been flawless.  We don't listen to music in that room, so I cannot truly comment on that aspect.<br />I found the setup to be very simple.  I estimated how far away the speakers were from where I was sitting then plugged in the microphone device and placed it in the most center seating and then you can adjust the sound from each speaker as it automatically goes from one to the next.<br />We got it right before Christmas in 2014 so it is still new, and I will update this if things go bad, but so far so good!<br />Very hard to beat for the price, as many other reviewers have said
20290	1	2	Y	Jewelry	B001K7618M	Star K Heart Shape 12mm Simulated Emerald Pendant Sterling Silver	Not as nice as it looked online.	This item was not as nice as it looked online.  The stone was too big to be realistic.  It looked like colored glass.  The setting was big and clunky, much too thick. The setting lacked fine detail I expected.
16846	1	4	Y	Electronics	B000RSOV50	La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Charger	Amazing Charger. Almost everything!!!	This charger brought back to life over two dozen Energizer batteries that my normal Energizer charger wouldn't recharge. The charge/discharge process brought the batteries back to life and gave an estimate of their capacity (mAh). It also offers multiple charging rates and defaults to the slow charge which is best for the long-term life of the battery. The only thing I would love is a backlight for the display.

13657	1	4	Y	Video DVD	B008HFS4XU	Dylan, Bob - Down In The Flood	Dylan And The Band-Before And After The Flood	"I must admit that I approached this dvd with a fair degree of scrutiny, due to the fact that it was one of those ""UNAUTHORIZED"" releases. I must say, however, both my friend & myself were very pleased with this recent release. Due to the fact that it was unauthorized, I had to look very closely at exactly who was involved in the making of this dvd. With some rare footage of recordings, some performance footage, and talking heads mainly with key participants that included rock journalist Robert Christgau, producer John Simon, & musicians Garth Hudson, Mickey Jones, & Charlie Mccoy, this documentary is very informative & enjoyable. Essentially beginning with some very early footage of The Hawks, who would later become The Band, & Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 performing his hits ""Mary Lou"" & Forty Days, the dvd moves forward capturing all of the important events that charted Dylans' progression with The Band between 1965-1976. Both fans of Dylan, as well as of The Band, will thoroughly enjoy this dvd. The Hawks attracted Dylan's attention while both were playing in Greenwich Village. Both drummer/vocalist Levon Helm & guitarist Robbie Robertson were in the electrified backup group at Dylan's controversial Forest Hills, New York concert of August 28, 1965. Despite a falling out between Dylan and Helm, Dylan then hired The Hawks-with drummerdylan's Mickey Jones in place of Helm-for his controversial 1965-66 world tour. This became the beginnings of a longtime collaboration for both parties . After Dylan's July 29, 1966 famous motorcycle accident, the group settled near the suddenly reclusive Dylan in the Woodstock, New York, area. Shortly thereafter Helm rejoined & they began to record what would evolve into ""The Basement Tapes"". The Band also began to record their own material as well. Most of this new material was written by Roberson and Richard Manuel in a basement studio in the group's house, known as ""Big Pink"". This evolved into Music From Big Pink by The Band. The Band's 2nd LP was simply titled ""The Band"",& Christgau & Simon stressed the importance of the LP as the beginning of what would be known as ""Americana"" music. The dvd then carefully charts the startling new direction that Dylan's music took. Evolving into John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, New Morning, & Planet Waves, which was recorded with The Band. The commentary by the soft-spoken Garth Hudson, who was the Band's organ player, is very interesting. Mickey Jones, the drummer for the infamous tour, spoke of how the crowds would only boo louder as the tour progressed. This only drove Dylan & The Band to play louder, which would only infuriate crowds even more. There is footage from other sources, such as Eat The Document, Don't Look Back, & even Monterey Pop. But there is a substantial amount of footage of the tour, as well as some sessions never seen before, to satisfy both fans of Dylan, as well as the Band. The dvd also emphasizes the idea of how both Dylan & The Band influenced & toured with each other, especially in 1974. The dvd also strongly stresses the importance of this new ""Americana"" music which The Band introduced even more strongly with their 2nd LP. There is even time given to the importance of the very 1st bootleg LP ""Great White Wonder"". All in all, fans of Dylan and/or the Band, will find the dvd a welcome delight. The running time is 114 minutes & it flows along very well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!!"

I told him this was a gimmick and he said that it wasn't. Well, what do you know? It did absolutely nothing.<br /><br />I'm a pretty thin guy already and I avoid processed foods and sugar because I'm diabetic. I don't work out either, so nothing should have interfered with this product working. My abs stayed the same.

All 3 feature great styling and outstanding fit and finish for dollars spent. My only gripe is that all three lose time-about 5 seconds a week. But I still really like and recommend them.
17920	1	5	Y	Wireless	B004TXRG4W	Case-mate Tough Case for HTC Inspire 4G, Black / Black	Fantastic	I have had this case for years and its still working perfectly. In all that time the only issue I had was a bit of the plastic on the top corner breaking off because I kept having to remove the cover to take the battery out of my phone (it was just aesthetic it didn't cause any functionality problems). Besides that it has been a great case. I just got a new Galaxy S3 and I ordered this case for that phone as well. Definitely recommend.

11939	1	5	Y	Camera	B0029U0XF6	Sony HVLF20AM TTL Digital Flash for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras	Good with my NEX 6	I tried to use a cheap substitute on my NEX 6 to avoid buying an expensive flash.  After a dismal failure with a Polaroid wanna be...I wound up ordering this little guy used.  Works perfectly with the NEX 6 with the Universal Shoe.  BUT YOU DO HAVE TO PURCHASE THE Sony ADPMAA Shoe Adaptor for Mi Shoe.  NEX 6 WILL NOT WORK IN TTL MODE WITHOUT THE SHOE ADAPTER.  Love the compactness and speed this guy provides.  A nice accessory for the NEX line of Sony's.
16652	1	5	Y	Automotive	B003YN9IX0	Depo 331-2001PXAS Diamond Fog Lamp Assembly	"According to my kids, these lights are ""SICK!"" (Which I understand is a good thing? LOL)"	We recently picked up a 1998 F150 at a federal surplus auction for just over $500. To get it roadworthy we needed to replace the rusted-out front bumper with a new one (also purchased through Amazon). The kids and I decided to add the foglights while we had the bumper off. The original only had pieces of plastic covering the holes, but our Expedition has similar lights and these are much nicer looking than the original equipment. We took a picture of the before and after (different cameras and different sun lights, so paint looks different), and I can tell you that these lights sparkle like a diamond in a ring.  These lights are helping to turn this old &#34;beater&#34; into a &#34;bragger&#34;! I don't think you can beat the value. I am pretty impressed. Good luck with your upgrades.
16625	1	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B0002CZWN6	Promark PW5AW Japanese Shira Kashi White Oak Wood Single Pair	The Perfect Stick	Finally found it. Took me a few years. But I finally found it.<br /><br />Used these in a metal band and they'd last just long enough to keep their stability, strength, leverage and sound quality. Then they'd break. Which they're supposed to do.<br /><br />Now I play them in a blues band and they last even longer, but again, will go a loooong way before losing tone/feel. Love these guys!

I also love the Vinium vacumm pump feature because I usually throw the cork after screwing it from the wine bottle and having this on the bottle efficiently preserve the freshness of the wine after days or even weeks storing it inside the fridge. You can also pump and pour the wine on a glass perfectly without a single drop. And hey! A nice matte box was included in case you want this as a gift to a friend or loved one! It's a really helpful tool if you drink wine regularly or occasionally.

For the most part these headphones work as advertised.  If you get a good seal you can listen to music while doing flip turns.  But the seal invariably breaks and then you have to stop and adjust and it gets you out of rhythm.  So, what I am saying is that it is a miracle product that has made me wish for more.
14941	1	5	Y	Toys	B002V3RCE6	Wonder Forge Richard Scarry's Busytown, Eye Found It	Entertaining!!!	It can keep my kids (6&8) busy for hours. The youngest one tends to distract easily but this game helps them focus while looking for the items. I try to play often to create a habit.

Using this with an apple tv, and a dvd player.  The picture quality is very nice.  It is light weight and easy to mount too my wall mount.  Setup was easy and intuitive.  Matching the setup protocol on my other Samsung tvs.<br /><br />The sound quality on this tv is outstanding.  It is one of the first I have every bought where I have no desire to add a sound bar or external speakers.  The sound is very crisp and quite loud.<br /><br />I wish tv manufactures placed all of the inputs on the back.  When the hdmi and usb plugs are on the side it creates cord clutter.<br /><br />I have had good luck with samsung tv sets.  I also own a 52 inch plasma and a 42 inch lcd.  The first is now two years old and the second is three years old.  Both have worked just fine without any issues.  It is because of my two prior tv sets that I chose this one.

20197	1	4	Y	Sports	B004CFYFDW	Cellerciser Portable Tri-Fold plus Balance Bar	Excellent	The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is (still, like all others) not maintenance-free -- the springs still require lubrication. I got one for my son a year ago and he uses it regularly. He reports it has gotten really noisy. I can report, from many years of experience with a Needak rebounder, that oil helps. But, over time, very slowly and unnoticed, microdrops of oil built into stains on the carpet. We are going to try small amounts of white (lithium) grease, instead (think Pep Boys). Eventual spring breakage and replacement is unavoidable. And, stubborn as I am, I ignore their advice and replace them only as they break; not all at the same time.<br />I bought a Cellerciser for myself at my son's urging due to the gentleness of the rebound itself. It is far gentler, which is important if disc verterbra impact is important to you.<br />In summary, it is the best I have experienced and would recommment it highty. Tri-fold and rolling carry case are great.<br />My personal opinion only: I think the &#34;maintenance problem&#34; with the bungee type rebounder will be worse due to the expense of the bungees and frequency of replacement. If silence is primary, bungee is the choice.
13426	1	5	Y	Electronics	B008FQMUL8	Beats Pill 2.0 Portable Speaker - Red	Has a great osund	this little machine gives off great sound have had no problems with it to date and I use it all the time you can pair a few i phones with it which is great!!!
7150	0	5	Y	Sports	B0038P0YQY	Browning G-10 Drop Point Knife	Extremely sharp !	Knves should be used for a while until you can have a well-based opinion on them. These are my first impressions only. This folding knife is well made and looks solid. It is very easy to sharpen. It seems to retain the sharpness in normal use, but I will wait a little longer for the final verdict.
11968	1	5	N	Watches	B00ENF168I	"Invicta Women's 15248 ""Pro Diver"" Stainless Steel Dive Watch"	Excellent Style & Function for the largish gal	I purchased this Pro Diver locally as a gift for a girlfriend who like me is tall and a bit &#34;big boned&#34;. The Diver Pro is larger than the average women's watch, but that's good for women who are tall with larger frames. The person I'm getting this for is over 6ft tall and her wrist is proportionally larger than a more average sized woman.  I purchased two similar Invicta watch models for myself. The closest of the two I bought is the [[ASIN:B00FALPY0A Invicta Women's 15134SYB Pro Diver Silver]] which has a slightly narrower and black ring on the bezel and is a little less expensive. The other I got is the [[ASIN:B00FALPXMY Invicta Women's 15136SYB Pro Diver Blue]]. These are a bit different and also very nice within the same theme. I'm very pleased with both of these.  This is a very good looking watch with an athletic feel. My aging eyes can read the time easily in the morning without glasses. That is, on my similar model with the same size face. That wasn't so true for my [[ASIN:B00068TIGI Seiko watch]] modeled after a lady Rolex Jubilee which has a much smaller face. I bought it last century and it remains a very nice watch with an elegant look.  The silver face and diver's bezel make a striking fashion statement and I feel it is a very attractive look. The band is comfortable and perfectly fits the design of the watch. It looks good on my wrist and I am sure it will work well for my girlfriend when she gets it at Christmas.  This watch is certainly oversize for the wrist of a petite or smaller boned woman, though that can sometimes be a striking fashion statement as well. It appears solidly made like it will hold up well for the active woman banging it around out in the world.  On the two I got for myself and having examined this one I'm totally pleased with both the function and fashion in the Invicta Pro Diver watches.  I have not gone swimming with my Pro Diver watches and I doubt I'll ever take more than 12ft under water, so waterproof isn't the least concern for me. I'm confident it's great in that area but I'll probably never test that aspect of the watch.  Petite women or with slender wrists should be aware it's somewhat over-sized and it is a bit heavier than smaller and less rugged watches.  Hope this helps someone with their buying decision.
4130	0	5	N	PC	B0054JGGGY	Razer Mamba Rechargable Wireless PC Gaming Mouse	Razar Mamba	Pros:<br />I love Razer packaging. I believe it is the start of the experience and design that shows they pay attention to detail.<br />This product is very easy to instal and setup. The wide variety of settings and possible programing make it ideal through several types of games and uses.<br /><br />Con:<br />While it is wireless, the wireless requires the included base. This is fine for desktop uses, but for a laptop it would have been nice to see Bluetooth like the Razer Orochi.<br /><br />Overall I love the Razer family of mice so far, and will be looking into their keyboards next.

Then, it started to take a lot of time to recharge the battery to 100%. Now, after 6-7 hours my phone is just 80% recharged. At the beginning I thought that the charger itself has issues, but, when connecting the phone to my laptop, through this cable, it doesn't recharge well, either: the same problem...after 6-7 hours it stops recharging even if it has reached the level of 80%.<br />I tried to recharge my phone with a standard Samsung charger (without USB cable), and the recharge level easily gets to 100%.<br />So, in my opinion, the cable is the source of all problems.

14038	1	4	Y	Camera	B00CNI3W5W	Gariz Genuine Leather BL-ZBSBK Black Label Compact Camera Zoom Case Bag for Mirrorless Camera, Black Label	Beautiful case.	Greatest quality camera case ever. Actual leather. Great camera protection; soft inside. great strap. innovative inside lens protective sleeve, although that is NOT leather, rather some kind of plastic; it is soft on the lens' side.<br />The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that it did NOT give net inside dimensions - it is NOT deep enough for Samsung NX300 with 18-55mm lens.
15868	1	5	Y	Luggage	B008A0F6ZG	World Traveler Black Silver Fleur de Lis Duffle Bag 22-inch	Gym Bag Convenience with Luggage Pattern and good price	I love this bag because it is lightweight and can carry a ton like a gym bag but has a nice pattern like a piece of luggage. My luggage is a pain sometimes because the fabric is really nice but its so heavy. I just used it for a 2 week summer vacation and it fit all my clothes, shoes and toiletries. The long pocket in front is large enough to hold a brush and a flat iron and then there is a separate,second pocket which is nice to keep the dental care /q-tips/cotton balls separate from the hair stuff.

For this price, it is very good purhase. I assembled it in half hour as all rear end came assembled already. Gears and brakes etc are already came installed. I had to adjust the gears and brakes easily and its ready for a ride. The rear brake cable was damaged during shipment and i contacted Kent (importer) and they confirmed shipment of a new one free.

I have little figurines that constantly fall over and lose their heads when the cats decide to jump on or off the bookcase. It keeps delicate things standing upright. It works well on candles and top heavy vases. It's tacky without being a mess. You can pop it off any surface. I haven't noticed any staining on my wooden shelves. A good product.
15551	1	5	N	Tools	B00FIX126K	Nite Ize DoohicKey Key Tool Keychain Multi-Tool, Stainless, 1-Pack	A Multipurpose Key That Will Unlock Your Inner MacGyver	In addition to opening doors, that set of keys in your pocket also serves as makeshift knives, prybars, and even ice scrapers. But why risk accidentally bending a key and losing access to your home when this key-sized multi-tool can do so much more?<br /><br />What you're looking at here is actually five tools in one including a box cutter, a bottle opener, a metric and imperial ruler, a multi-sized wrench, and a flat-head screwdriver. But that's just its official uses. With enough imagination this can come in handy for countless other uses, even gaining access to your home if your actual key's gone MIA.

These are probably the best graphics I've seen on my ps4 so far. The game is very well polished. This is one of the most brutal video games I've ever played.

It took a few days but after around the 2nd or 3rd day...wow...I am barely in pain any more. Symptoms including bloating and pain in my stomach have subsided big time. I think it wil get even better after using it longer. Used to just take probiotics which have helped me too but adding this to my regimen seems to have been the right combination for me personally. The difference to my life is wonderful. I recommended them to my sister who has similar digestion woes like me.

The machine will keep showing you load paper option.   Other than that, this printer is not too bad. Cheap printer, cheap and fragile body and functionality it has. You really get what you pay for. Do not expect a sturdy and durable body of a printer or very neat/fast/economic way of printing.

It is very compact and I can barely tell that it is in my pocket, the pocket clip is great by the way and it is just the right size and never gets caught up because it is to tight or too small.

It is small, light, and inexpensive (they cost $200+ in Australia).<br /><br />However, I am worried about the clasp, as I have heard a few horror stories, and it needs to be double-checked. The glass does not seem particularly hardy, but that is an issue for another time.

The day i got the item, the package was amazing and it had sora on it as exepected and when i opened it the chain was perfect then after about 3 minutes the keyblade broke it wan't under any kind pressure it wasn't even exposed to heat or water.  I thougt i could wear it even though it broke after a while (around 15 mins.) the chain (wich isn't even metal) the coating started to peel of i was diapointed, if you want to wear a necklace i purpose you look elese where if you want a long-lasting necklace i suggest the Heartless necklace or the set of sora's keyblade pendant set.  Overall the product is really cheap and i don't think it matches the price but this is my view consider this as only a view on the necklace.

Very versatile and extra long cord make cleaning up small jobs easy.  You'll be amazed at the power this little baby puts out.  Don't recommend for doing the car, hose is too short for most crevices and it's heavy to have to hold the entire vacuum inside the car instead of just the long hose from your shop vac.  all in all, it's worth the price.

It was frustrating for us both since it interrupted her creativity and I was the one that had to keep rethreading it. I'm not familiar with sewing machines at all, but I knew if we didn't get something simpler for my daughter to use, she might lose her interest. Fortunately, we were able to try out the new Singer 1304 Starter Basic and it's been a better choice for my daughter so far. It doesn't have super fancy stitches or LCD displays, but it is simple to set up and operate. It's also pretty compact in size so it fits in the small area we've dedicated for her crafting. She hasn't had the time to use it extensively, but as time passes, I'll try to update this review with more of our experience with the Singer 1304.
11734	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B007TXTDPO	goDog Dinos with Chew Guard Technolog Tough Plush Dog Toy	Adorable...but not so tough	This toy is adorable, almost too cute to give to my destroyer Chesapeake's. But at the low price I got them for (I bought two), it was worth it. While this toy is far from indestructible...the neck is the weakest link...it did last longer than most. They actually didn't set out to destroy this toy...they carried them around, tossed them, pounced on them, occasionally chewed on them, but generally took good care of them. The Dino actually lasted two whole months! Which is very impressive! But once the neck cracked and a tiny bit of stuffing flew out that was the end! Next thing I know I have decapitated Dinos lying in a pile of stuffing. I could have sewed the end of the toy, but it was pretty much a gonner. I let them have a few extra days to finish off the body, and then Mom had to bury them in the garbage can.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun, neat toy to have around...but if your dog is a destroyer just avoid stuffed toys altogether. No matter how tough they claim to be, they never live up to the status.

The TV's internal antenna got weak signals so I couldn't get any channels.  I went to other stores to see what I could find for antennas.  Everything was $30 to $40 and huge.  I figured, $10 through Amazon Prime.  Why not?  Glad I got it, it's cheap and it works.  I get at least 29 channels, some with weak or staticy analog signals, but, it's better than zero before.<br /><br />I haven't even mounted it yet, just plugged it in and stuck it on a plastic jar, near my TV and it works.

1797	0	4	N	Toys	B004P95ABG	LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 7965	Awesome model, but a bit flimsy once put together	"I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic ""New Hope"" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it."

Very well made knife with great fit & finish .  Ergonomics are decent - not the best, but certainly not the worst, and for the price it's certainly nothing to complain about!  The blade is extremely robust and made from Japanese AUS8a stainless steel.  The knife however is made in Taiwan, but in my personal experience, I've found that blades made in Taiwan sport the same quality as USA made products.<br /><br />The only negative I can say about this knife is that it's on the heavy side for an EDC folder.  But otherwise, it's a great hard use folder for outdoors and self defense.  Amazing blade for $20  Recommended!

We've tried five colic reducing bottles, and we never detected a difference in symptoms based on the bottle. These have fewer parts than doc browns or the avent classics, and I personally like the way they feel to hold better than the others. Great that they're glass. My daughter can collapse the nipple when she's really hungry ( unlike others), but it fixes immediately when she pauses so it hasn't been a problem for us. She likes to play with the surface of the bottle and ring while she's drinking, and one time she unscrewed the top without us knowing, until everything spilled. But I think I must not have had it screwed on completely, because it hasn't happened again. Nothing's perfect in our experience, but these were the best, with avent classics being our second favorites.

16642	1	4	Y	Watches	B000XECH6I	TAG Heuer Men's WAH1110.BA0850 Formula 1 Professional Watch	Nice lookingwatch with sapphire crystal and 200M water resistance	This is my 2nd TAG. Nice looking watch with sapphire crystal and 200M water resistance, but not terribly accurate. Has a so-so ETA movement. Bought it in 2008 and had to have battery replaced in 2011. Now have to have battery replaced again (March, 2015), and decided to have TAG do it. So I sent to TAG for estimate, which cost me $35 insured through UPS. At first cheapest service they would offer that includes battery replacement was $95. Ouch! Then was told watch needed complete overhaul at $170. So that's $205 to replace the battery!!!!!!! Probably hadn't worn it 100 times since I've owned it (special occasions only), and it is in pristine condition. You can get the battery replaced anywhere, but if you want gaskets replaced, reputable jewelers will send it to TAG and probably charge you a premium for their time. IMHO, this is a BIG rip off by TAG's aftermarket service group in NJ. Definitely not going to buy another TAG for sure. Next watch will probably be Seiko dive watch of the &#34;Tuna&#34; variety which has much better movement, is water resistant to 300M, and is almost $200 cheaper. Consider yourself warned.

10485	0	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00RO7ZXKO	WeeTV M8 Kodi/XBMC 14.2 Quad Core Android 4.4.2 KitKat 2G/8G 4K TV Box with 3D-HD Blu-ray Streaming Media Player, Dual 2.4/5GHz WiFi, Bluetooth, Netflix, YouTube, DLNA and Airplay	5 STAR	One of the best products I've ordered for our church kiosk. In use now for a few years with no problems whatsoever. I'm just amazed at complexity within this little box that offers so much; sd/hd, usb, nice easy menus, remote, ext drive capable, etc, etc, etc. The only thing I would like to see is a network interface capability. If this box could look like a node, we could update it remotely without having to bring in a revised sd card or flash drive. That would be the coolest feature ever....to be able to simply send it a new video file and have it play.

6484	0	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00IGJG90C	InSassy (TM) Expandable Garden Water Hose (Green, 75 Feet Hose w/Spray Nozzle)	Great Investment!	I purchased the InSassy TM Expandable 75ft hose because I just moved to my new place and there was a lot of lawn and trees to water, and I wanted something light weight.  Due to my surprise when I received the package, it was light and arrived quickly; I was already excited to use the hose.  From reading previous reviews, how the hose pops and what not, I read the instructions that came with the hose to make sure I didn't use it wrong. The instructions were easy to understand, which I liked since I do not want to waste time trying to figure out how to use to hose.<br />It has been almost 2 months since I purchased the hose from InSassy and it has been a great product, the hose does not kink, durable and light and it has cut my chores to half the time. I have a busy schedule since I have to juggle work, kids and chores; this InSassy TM Expandable 75ft hose has saved me a lot of time and money. I would recommend this product with 2 thumbs up. Thank you, InSassy for making my life easier.

2936	0	3	N	Camera	B0090UMKRW	DNA 5050# Glide Gear Professional Video Camera Camcorder Stabilizer USA COMPANY LIFETIME WARRANTY	A Win-Win!	As an amateur, the price of the DNA5050 thrilled me. After getting it, I had a change of heart with my purchase. Don't get me wrong, I think that it's great. The truth is, it  didn't really fit my needs but the price sold me. It's way cheaper than another stabiliser of similar make that I've been eyeing for a while and I guess it was an impulse buy.<br /><br />In any case, there's nothing wrong with it. I spent a few weeks getting to know this Glide Gear stabiliser--I particularly enjoyed the easy release mounting plate--but in the end, it was not for me (my cameras are on the smaller and lighter side of basic, most often used is a Sony pj200 camcorder) and carrying the 5050 for teeny tiny cameras just felt and looked stupid. I ended up trading it with a friend for oddly enough another Glide Gear product (the DNA1000), which had come out later.<br /><br />So all things considered, it was still a great purchase. I avoided wasting and losing out on an impulse buy, got a great stabiliser along with a few other things that matched well with my cameras, and I bagged a lot of good will too.

11704	1	4	N	Books	0345468260	Timeline	Don't tell Harold Bloom I read this	Read this during Christmas break since a student (Tim) last semester recommended it while we were discussing the nature of time. Since I have enjoyed some of MC's other books - Next, Congo, State of Fear - I think years ago I read others too but have forgotten which ones, I looked forward to enjoying this book too. Please no one tell Harold Bloom I read MC's books or it will ruin my reputation! Well, never mind, I have no reputation. In any case, despite how gauche reading popular trite must seem, I enjoyed it thinking for sure it would make a great movie. What do you know! Of course there is already a movie since I am years behind the curve on this one. I have Micro but only read the first twenty pages so far. What sticks in my mind most is the book State of Fear which was loaded with footnotes, so seemed much more serious. But this one turns out not to seriously delve into the nature of time or the physics associated with current work. It really is just a novel that uses all the tried and true techniques to entertain, and that is pretty much it. Looks like it also became a computer game. It all fits.

The main compartment holds my Canon 5DMK II, 24-105, 200 2.8, 17-40, Sigma 85 1.4, battery charger, remote shutter release, a small Canon flash, and still has a little room for one or two other small things. One of the inner plastic envelopes holds the camera instruction book, the other holds batteries, both with room to spare. The two outer compartments hold my neutral density filters, filter holder, lens cleaners, and pocket flashlight, and there's still more room. The two pockets on either side perfectly hold a 77mm filter case. And I can attach my big Manfrotto tripod to the tripod holder.<br />The bag is sturdy and small enough to fit under an airplane seat. The zippers work smoothly. I love it.

6165	0	5	Y	Books	1455580392	The Heroic Path: In Search of the Masculine Heart	If you liked Wild At Heart, you will love The Heroic Path.	I have never been to Kodiak Island; I don't own a gun; I don't own a bow: I have never shot a duck, goose, pheasant, wild turkey, deer or elk.  I am, and have always been, a city dweller.  My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is &#34;real.&#34;  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all &#34;out there.&#34;  No, actually he brings you &#34;in there,&#34; into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.  Although I started the journey in to his mind and heart, I found myself walking a different path, my path, my past, my life, my heart, my soul, my failures, my fears, my shortcomings, my questions, deep personal and spiritual questions. At one point I stopped, closed the book, meditated about what I have just read and wondered, &#34;How could someone so &#34;young&#34; have so much insight, wisdom and thoughts that are supposed to occur when you are my age!?  Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no &#34;preachy&#34; words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.  I am curious to see how the book resonates with a the fairer gender.
11012	1	4	Y	Beauty	B001DNE3KQ	Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Menâs Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Cordless with Flexible Pivoting Head	I think I picked the right one...	After reading dozens of reviews about each of the electric shavers under $100 (and some over) I decided to give this one a chance. Now, after two weeks of use, I'm ready to report in.<br /><br />As someone with sensitive skin, I was excited to see how this would work. The head has a switch on the side which locks the blade or allows it move as you shaving.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Locked or unlocked mode is great for sensitive skin<br />Easy cleaning!<br />Battery life seems pretty good so far. I'll update if that changes over time<br />No issues of redness or difficulty adjusting at least for me.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />The noise! I know people mentioned that it was loud, but this high pitched buzz is difficult to muffle in the morning<br /><br />For anyone looking to upgrade their electric razor, as I was, this was a great choice.<br /><br />Update 1/10/13: Battery life still seems to be holding up (couple of hours with each charge) and the razor is still cutting the same. I'm sure I will have to replace the blades soon, but for now they are still getting the job done. But that buzzing is still loud...

Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. My friend has one one of these babies and I've gotta say, you haven't seen anything until you've seen that TV http://fave.co/1cwJN0j  Anyway, this TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage.  Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have. Pick yourself up a cheaper refurbished but still fully functioning TV! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R3E3FB2

Did it miraculously fix my neck?  Nope, not even close - but now I don't make my issues worse just by sleeping.<br /><br />I have been through every type of pillow you can name including the specialty cervical pillows and a super expensive memory foam.  This one blows them all out of the water.  You can &#34;arrange&#34; the filling so it fits you exactly - and the filling stays put all night.<br /><br />Yes, it's heavy.  But I don't intend to travel with it.  I even bought extra buckwheat fill and switched out the filling in my &#34;Bones&#34; pillow with buckwheat - it's just that good.

The InstaOutlet solved the problem. Advertised for adding Roku or Apple TV to a wall mount (doesn't matter - it gave me the outlet I needed behind the TV) and let me hide the power and connection wires. Very well made and did the job great. Definite recommend for any need like mine or anything else you want to add to wall mounted TV.

14949	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B0012V1G0Y	StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large	Great for high energy dogs!	I purchased three of these as Christmas gifts for some dogs. My senior pitbull and greyhound were not even remotely interested, but my dad's vizsla puppy was OBSESSED. She seriously loves this thing and it's the only thing that can keep her focused for more than three minutes. She is able to get the treat out, but that keeps her happy too because it's pretty large and hard. As with any treat you give your dog, you should not leave them with it unattended as they could choke. In the end we gave ours to a friend with some younger pitbulls who also loved this toy/treat. I would say its best for younger, high-energy dogs who still do a lot of playing. Our dogs may have just been too old to care about a treat that they had to work for. They like their treats handed to them with very little work done on their end. I don't blame them. I don't plan on working hard for my food when I'm old either.

11357	1	5	N	Outdoors	B00WA1SUEK	Lightess Rechargeable Zoomable LED Headlamp Cree XM L2 5 Modes Head Lamp Lights Head Torch LED Light for Camping, Hunting, Hiking.	This Headlamp Rocks	[[VIDEOID:c2df505db83f0cbd75f4a819155d06ef]]Do you want Power more than anything else from your headlamp? At anywhere near this price, this is it. Let me tell you about this headlamp, and I purchased my first one just like this one six months ago, so I know about them.    You're going to get a reasonably comfortable band, that can be improved on by wearing an athletic  headband under it. I think that it will adjust to anybody's head on this third rock from the sun and it works well.    On the back of it, is the power pack containing two, included 18650 batteries. I did a capacity test on them and they were measured at about 1200mAh, so the two will last quite a while, 3-5 hours or more on Low, but I'm using two 3100mAh in mine that test at over 3200mAh and now it really lasts.    This pack includes a USB port to charge it or any other device that you charge USB, and this comes with a wall charger for the pack too, so it arrives ready to charge and use. The pack has a rubber cover to pull off to insert the batteries and it stays attached by a little ring, so you won't drop or misplace it.    On the front is the lamp and it's got a magnifying lens. This lamp is what really rocks about this, it uses a good, white XM-L2 LED with a lot of output. I've never owned a more powerful headlamp and this will provide daylight at about 75 feet. It will also provide a huge, bright flood of light at 25 feet. You'll twist the ring on the light like a camera zoom, for magnification.    This uses a 5 setting switch with memory and you will need to click this one to cycle through them. It's High-Medium-Low-Strobe-SOS, and if you're on Medium and shut it off, it will remember to turn back on Medium, unless you don't wait long enough, in which case it would then cycle to Low.    This is very wide magnification that this lens is using, so it won't shine quite as far as my fixed lens flashlights like it, but this is still so much light that you will like this lamp, guaranteed.    Everything about this is okay, except that I really wish that they would have made the tilt more adjustable, you'll get four positions with three usable. These batteries work fine but you'll like it even better with an upgrade to higher rated ones. You might not get more than half a phone charge from these batteries, unless they are fully charged, and of course they won't power the light as long either. I'm using [[ASIN:B00O9XLOW2 These Batteries]], which cost more than the light does today, but it's 6400 vs 2400mAh and I could top off my phone twice and still have hours of light. 18650 batteries will recharge 500 times, so expensive batteries are cheap in the long run, it will depend on how often you charge them, but maybe only $2 a year. It's something to consider, mainly if you do want to charge a device from this or will use the headlamp where you can't charge it again for days.    Now after owning two of these headlamps, I love them twice as much. There are a few nits to pick, but this kind of Power at this price, fagetta bout it.    Recommended    This product was sent to me to test and review for you online shoppers.

1545	0	4	N	Video DVD	B00DJYJWVW	The Lone Ranger (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)	"A ""Must See"" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR"	"This movie is almost two and a half hours long. All-in-all it is a fun take on the old tale. (no new plot here, save for the in depth look at Tonto's past) Some Texas Rangers get ambushed and only one survives, leaving a Lone Ranger. A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film. Thirty minutes of it could have been edited out and the thing would have been perfect.  4 stars, A ""Must See"" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR"

Amazon sent a replacement very quickly. The replacement unit had the same problem, only worse. Returned that one also. Ordered the ""Gator"" Morphibian, thinking maybe it was just the ""Rover"" model that had the problem. The Gator model has the same problem.  This is really a shame because my kids really love the fact that these toys can go in the water. They are apparently poorly made and/or designed.  By the way, I also bought the ""Explorer"" model and it has not had any problems. But reading the reviews for that model leads me to think I may have just gotten extremely lucky with that one.  One positive: Amazon's return/replacement process is very easy and responsive (I got to test it out thoroughly)."

In my very small space I don't have room for a file cabinet. I wanted a wall system to file my active project folders, and happy colors to brighten up the space. At the same time, it is relatively flat against the wall/roof so it doesn't crowd my desk space or my elbow. It is easy to access the folders and return them to their resting place, so it keeps my desk clear and my visual space (and mind) uncluttered. Then I can collect it into a compact package so I can carry it to a better heated space when the weather is so cold it gets too drafty in my attic office. Did I mention that my attic walls are slanted? The folders don't fall out. The material is a poly type, so someday I expect that the corners might get brittle an crack a little, but I imagine by then I will be ready for a bit of decorative change--I figure that's what washi tape is for. The colorful liners DO come with the system.

16162	1	3	Y	Musical Instruments	B003LTJ404	Musician's Gear Heavy-Duty Folding Music Stand Black	Not as good as it looks	Not a bad stand for the house. Fairly stable. The desk part of the stand doesn't come off without removing some screws though so its not as portable as similar style stands. Also, the desk is not well attached to the base and I can see it breaking rather easily. On the plus side it is much lighter than similar style models and the price is right. I'm a professional musician and I always keep a stand like this in the trunk of my car. I leave these at gigs quite often, so as a disposable stand that ill probably lose in the next year its pretty good. if i was planning on keeping this in the house for years I think it's just ok...

I didn't believe it was really waterproof until I used it in my shower, it worked perfectly! I can be playing music upstairs and go downstairs and still hear the music. Plus, it works great with my old third generation iPod. I love the the bass too, usually when I get a speaker thereâs not enough bass but this has the perfect sound. And  the weight of it is so light I never have a problem moving it to several places in my house. Another cool thing about the boom box is that the battery reasonably long! I barely have to charge it. Overall, I love this product and would recommend to anyone that loves music.

12867	1	4	N	Video DVD	B00005NKT5	Toys	Underappreciated film, then and now...	This is a film that one either loved or hated.  Though I do not necessarily fall into the political spectrum that is reflected in this quasi-anti-war film, I have to acknowledge it was very well-made, utterly inventive, and refreshingly different.<br />The plot is straightforward(or so it seems) wherein a toy company has to decide whether to further stock 'war toys'.  A battle, in words and deeds, ensues, with creative special effects and innovative visuals.  Remember this was much earlier than 'Toy Story', etc.<br />Robin Williams is at his best and this takes on special significance in light of recent events.  LL Cool J is, well, cool.  The fussy 'general' character is a stereotype, but that is what was called for in the script.<br />It all blends wonderfully in a film that will surprise you and make you think...

The dock and charge parts are solid, function  like i'd hoped, i must say there's much packed into the pidock for the cost. The remote works fine on mine, i'm usually close so really no issues with the pidock.

In addition the pricing is just great, because<br />if you compare it to many other beds, it's just plain cheaper.<br /><br />The company has really high quality ingredients and I recommend using that company for other products as well.<br />On top of that, a fast shipping with a great customer support brought me an experience I will be sure to come back for more!

8416	0	5	N	Grocery	B00KXDPS60	Julian Bakery Paleo Coconut Flakes (Low Carb & Gluten Free) Cereal, 10 Servings	Just love it	This is my all time favorite cereal! That's saying a lot because I'm very picky when it comes to food. I initially tried it because of the coconut flavor. It tastes way too good to be so healthy, which is a big plus. It fills me up until lunch time. The paleo diet is something that my chiropractor used to always preach about, so I know for sure I'm eating healthy. I'm definitely hooked and will continue buying this cereal. It's well worth the money!I totally recommend this one
4878	0	5	N	Books	1463604726	Trekking the Annapurna Circuit and Annapurna Sanctuary in the Nepal Himalaya: Trekking the Annapurna Circuit and Annapurna Sanctuary in the Nepal Himalaya	Still the best guidebook to the Annapurna region	"Lots of people have enjoyed the Annapurna Circuit using this guidebook, which is a well established successful independent guidebook, written by a trekker for trekkers. The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.<br /><br />The guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called ""print on demand"" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.<br /><br />All I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.<br /><br />Ian Johnson<br />ianpjohnson@yahoo.com"

13393	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B000PVTLWW	"The Da Bird Super Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original 36"" Single Pole Cat Toy, Feather Refill, Sparkly Attachment, Kitty Puff Attachment & Peacock Feather)"	First toy that the cat played with for more than a couple minutes.	"This only arrived yesterday, and, due to the multiple reviews about fiberglass shards or splinters from the pole, I almost didn't buy this. I went ahead and ordered it, but was prepared for splinters by having bought some duct tape (as suggested by reviewers) to cover the pole with. However, tape was not necessary because the pole looks and feels like smooth, flexible plastic. This is the ""original"" toy and pole, so perhaps only the later models are made of fiberglass??<br /><br />This Da Bird Super Pack is a good deal, with 5 toys altogether (1 on the pole + 3 refills + the peacock feather which is so long by itself that it doesn't have (or need) anything to fasten it to the pole because it can be used on its own. For the price, including shipping, this was the best deal I've seen.<br /><br />My cat was a stray, and hasn't been with me for long, and it is a major adjustment for her to be indoors all the time after having roamed freely for an unknown period of time. I really want her to have fun, mental stimulation, and exercise, so I was thrilled to see her play with Da Bird yesterday. What's nice about this is that she can catch it often which keeps her interested - unlike the Loco Laser which is just a tease that she can never catch and therefore has lost interest in. She only plays with her Midnight Crazies balls and her catnip mice for very brief spells. With Da Bird she has all the behaviors & excitement of chasing real prey, and plenty of exercise. Since the toy mimics live prey, I suspect she will remain interested in it. Will post if she doesn't.<br /><br />Reviewers are also correct in that the attachments come apart easily. The largest feather already fell off yesterday. I'm saving it to use with other feathers that will eventually fall off, and will make a new toy out of them.<br /><br />With this set having newly arrived, I haven't yet tried the other attachments or the peacock feather, and am trying to ""stretch"" them by using one at a time until each one is worn out...<br /><br />For the enjoyment and exercise this has given my cat, and the price of the Super Pack, I'm giving it 5 stars even though the feather has already fallen off."

12513	1	4	N	Books	0232520089	Holy Listening: The Art of Spiritual Direction	a practical guide with lots of examples	Accompanying people on their journey, providing space, teaching and learning discernment, avoiding eccentricities)<br /><br />From the book:<br /><br />Spiritual direction is uncovering the obvious. We have been on the move since the expulsion from Eden. Hospitality is important and my redesigned living room will enable this. She felt that her years as a teacher prepared her for this.<br /><br />For most of us, loose ends are frightening reminders of our own powerlessness. To name, to label, to classify gives us the illusion of control, even if the closure reached is a false one.<br /><br />In all events, it is important to leave the directee free to accept or reject our insights. Whether we are right, wrong or premature, it is reassuring to remember that we cannot do too much harm since people rarely hear what they are not ready to hear. At the very least, we have possibly planted a seed. As director-midwives, then, we must be willing to wait for the seed to sprout -- if it is supposed to sprout -- and grow to maturity, perhaps long after our relationship with the directee has ceased.<br /><br />If you feel bored by a conversation, the person might be depressed.<br /><br />Like children, directees are on loan.<br /><br />Books should be prescribed cautiously because directee might feel guilty if not appropriate.<br /><br />To clarify: `Tell me more.' `I don't quite understand.'<br /><br />The spiritual director as teacher does not make the connections, although she may make observations, give hints (but without being manipulative), and ask the right questions. Her supportive presence sets the directee free to make the connections; and inner and outer work turn out to be all of a piece.<br />We may spare the very fragile, those who have already more reality than they can bear and are not yet ready to hear the truth. It is sometimes hard to sit with an insight, yet we may say nothing, or we may measure out manageable bits of truth. But with the strong and spirituallymature we need not be so cautious.<br /><br />Can tell one's own story if invited or intuit.<br /><br />The purpose of education is to show a person how to define himself authentically and spontaneously in relation to his world -- not to impose a prefabricated definition of the world, still less an arbitrary definition of the individual himself (Thomas Merton, Love and Living, p. 3)
14796	1	5	Y	Pet Products	B000X2RUX0	Everlasting Large Bento Ball	We love this.	My dog loves this treat and toy. I put kibble in one side and the everlasting treat in the other. Good for her teeth, keeps her busy, but I have to keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't pop the toy out and eat it all quickly. Is it perfect? No. My dog tore part of it which is disappointing, but my dog really loves this toy and this toy is for her. She gets very excited when I have a new everlasting treat to put in it. It gives her something to focus her energy on and it's easy and quick to refill. Once a month I get a couple everlasting treats on autodelivery which makes the treat a lot cheaper (about $2.50 a piece). For me, I'm happy it's a dental treat. I want my dog to have nice teeth for a long time and I am happy to say that this toy/treat is making everyone happy around here.<br /><br />Bonus: it is NOT noisy. It's a silicon-ish kind of material so even when it's bouncing around on our ceramic floors it doesn't make much of a sound. A lot of dog toys are cheap and noisy. And annoying. This one isn't. So if you are seeking out toys that are quiet this is a good one.
6404	0	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B00J7Y5HTO	Design Toscano American Mountain Cougar Statue	Fierce and wise guardian	I put this out on the front steps, its kind of like our guard-cat. He looks fierce and real (you can even see his muscles!), but he also looks wise and watchful. He has striking blue eyes that look right at you, and he could pounce at any moment. My little girls will feel safe knowing that Simba is guarding them (I told them it wasn't a lion-but they were set on a name from the moment I opened the box). I couldn't be happier with our fierce mountain cougar (or lion).
10856	1	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B000W72GBC	No-Spill 1405 2-1/2-Gallon Poly Gas Can	The best!	This gas can is a lot better than what I had before. The push button no-spill nozzle is super convenient and worth the price of admission alone! My old gas can's nozzle wasn't work so I'd always have to simply screw off the nozzle and pour from the can itself, which was really annoying and messy. One day I got sick of it enough and came across this gas can and ordered it. I can safely say this was the right decision and I'd recommend this to any of my peers any day.

Long have I been waiting for a gadget to be able to cut identical thin slices of my vegetables and fruits.<br />And my wife and I use this ceramic blade almost every day in making our stew, sautÃ© and salads.  This was definitely worth it, a great tool that is easy use, keep and clean.

I'm not a professional cyclist, but I love attaching this camera to my helmet and go out with it during my bicycle rides and just press attention to the little details you don't get to see while riding.

With this music receiver device, the sound is clear and rich, with NO distortions. I have only tried to connect to the Belkin Bluetooth device IN my 21' room, and it connects effortlessly. For those that try to connect from Mother Russia, I suggest that you look elswhere. If you remove the iphone/ipad from the room or move behind a wall, all bets are off!

It comes with instructions on how to inflate and how much to inflate it to. The only thing I wasn't happy about is something that other reviewers mentioned...the pump. Oh man, the pump. It's awful. Takes F O R E V E R to inflate. I didn't have another way to inflate it, so let's just say I got some arm exercise in! Overall, though, it's a good product!

18582	1	4	Y	Home	B0008E0AFS	Maas International Metal Polish Can, 1.1-Pound	Doesn't clean so well, but once clean lasts a long time	"I have a full set of copper cookware that hangs over my sink on a rack. I've had it for 35 years and while I rarely (if ever use it) I like the look of it hanging there. It gets pretty grimey and tarnished and some spots are impossible to clean. I looked forward to this product, but found that it did not clean very well. Maybe if I spent an hour rubbing and rubbing it might do the job, but with 14 pieces who has the time and the 1,000 rags/paper towels. So I cleaned my set using that old faithful since 1882 Bar Keeper's Friend and then cleaned with Maas and yes, more tarnish came off. And it was worth recleaning and there is something in Maas that keeps the tarnish away longer than anything else. Perhaps it is because you don't use water to ""clean"" it off that protects the shine. So I am happy enough with that."

At first I tried applying it with the Bare Minerals concealer brush, but I found it sat on top of my skin, creased, and looked grainy. I wasn't at all happy with it. Then inspiration struck. Mix it with a dab of eye cream or moisturizer and apply it as a cream. This works perfectly. It covers smoothly, without creasing or looking grainy. It works great under the eyes, across the bridge of the nose, and on any blemishes. I couldn't be happier with it.

I have been having it on oatmeal, French toast, in my coffee and tea. I am going to try baking with it. It tastes like a mix between brown sugar and caramel and I don't feel guilty eating it which is a huge bonus. I lost 2lbs this week so perhaps it helped. I would definitely recommend trying it.

13248	1	4	N	Home Improvement	B00IJIPO10	Bulbrite LED11A19/827/D 11-Watt (60-Watt) Dimmable LED A19, Medium Base, Warm White	Very nice LED bulb	What's not to love about Bulbrite's LED A19 bulb?  LED's have come a long way in just the last few years and I've equipped my home with quite a few of them by this point.  The gains in energy efficiency have been well documented by this point and as of the summer of 2014, I've yet to have any of my 7-8 LED bulbs go out on me which isn't surprising since they are supposed to last for years.<br /><br />So what I'm looking for in good LED bulb at this point is the function of the dimmer capabilities and the warmth (aka temperature) of the bulb.  My biggest issue with LED's is that they can still be a bit harsh inside, even the warm white (2700K) bulbs.<br /><br />As far the dimmer capabilities go, this bulb is top notch...it dims quickly and is sensitive enough to work fairly well with my dimmer.  You do have to turn it on at least medium to activate the light but then it will go lower and dimmer than most of my other LED bulbs.  Regarding temperature, I've found that all 2700K bulbs are not created equal.  This one is warmer and softer than other 27K LED's that I have, but they haven't gotten it as warm as I would like in an ideal situation.  Overall, I still like using LED for the energy savings and I would recommend the Bulbrite bulb if you are looking for an LED.

12733	1	4	Y	Camera	B00P8BOEXA	Photomate 15 inch Hi-Resolution Digital Picture Frame with Motion Sensor & 4GB Built-in Memory	Almost perfect	So far, we like the frame. We bought it to use at our county fair for a digital photography class. 4 stars only because it doesn't hold the program after you turn it off and you have to reset it each time you turn it on. Also, your choice of time for each frame is 3 sec. 5 sec. then 15 seconds. 7 to 10 would be perfect. You can turn off the motion sensor so it keeps playing if no one is around, which is what we need. I put various sized pictures on it and they all filled the screen correctly without shrinking or stretching so that part will work great for what we're doing. The pictures display great, very representative of what they looked like coming off the camera which is what we need for judging. I'm trying video on it next week. I'll update if it doesn't work as expected.  UPDATE: I can't get more than 5 pictures to show from the 30 on the SD card or on the USB drive. Same 5 pictures. Also, I haven't been able to get it to recognize any videos that I've tried to show. I have it saved as an AVI but it doesn't recognize it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!

In my gun safe, I removed some of the barrel dividers as I have no fear of leaning the rifles against each other with these socks on.  Freed up enough space for 2 more guns on the one side of the safe.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because the material is a little light.  I have other knit gun socks from Allen and those just feel better made.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase again, in fact, I did.

This device is exactly what I needed to get rid of the PC in the living room. The custom android software that is installed has a few caveats though.<br /><br />1: The navigation bar on the bottom should be hideable. Maybe when in mouse mode show the navigation bar, when in default mode, hide the bar, as it cant be selected in default mode anyways. I have a camera feed that displays full screen, annoying having these navigation buttons being displayed, and not having a choice on whether i want see them or not.<br /><br />2: For some reason the hotspot functionality is automatically turned on after each reboot even if hotspot is turned off before the device powers down. Very frustrating. I understand the purpose of hotspot functionality for a mobile phone or tablet that has a cell connection, but on a media device for a TV that itself needs a network connection to operate?<br /><br />Note to Manufacturer: If your going to customize the OS, finish the job and you will impress above and beyond.

It has a shiny black coat and is very smooth. The handle is larger in comparison to the other kettlebells I own--I have 2 GoFit and 1 Body Solid. It is both larger around the circumference of the handle itself, AND there is a larger space in the area between the handle and top of the bell. This works out well for me, I can get a better grip with a single hand because of the thicker width.

20195	1	3	N	Video Games	B002P77432	Tritton TRIAX-180 AX 180 Stereo Gaming Headset for Xbox 360 and Playtation 3	Tread Carefully...	I bought my first set of AX-180s several months back. I decided to purchase the 2 year warranty for the headset, and boy am I glad I did! After hooking them up, I was pleased to be experiencing enhanced audio for my online gaming for the first time. For a 50 dollar headset, I wasn't expecting the greatest quality, but in fact, they definitely surpassed my expectations. Unfortunately, after a little over a month of use, I began having issues with the voice output on my microphone. It started with that loud blood curdling screech that only my friends could hear, following shortly after with a complete loss of voice communication on my end. Now, I understand that this happens with headsets... but that happens OVER TIME! I took the headset back to have them replaced. The second pair was much more polished (and by polished, I simply mean there were small details I noticed about this pair, that the older pair didn't have) and lasted longer... about 5 months longer. Until the same thing began to happen again (I started to see a trend), but this time, the whole left speaker went out. I was able to narrow it down to a connection issue with the left connector that hooked into the module. I decided that that was the last straw. I took them back again and upgraded to the AX-720s. I really hope that I am not just cursed when it comes to the 180s, but I really do find the 720s much better as far as performance goes. The 180s are a great headset. However, to me, you just can't really stop those small electrical malfunctions unless you're educated on fixing those problems. I hope this review was helpful. I would really like to know if anyone else was having problems with these headsets as well.

After a bit of fussing around and learning how they work we got them hooked up and functioning well.  The two things that were a bit of a challenge were scanning for channels, removing the ones we do not want or do not come in well --and-- preventing the device from shutting off after four hours.  After these two issues were solved they are performing great.  The only other thing was one of the devices had a broken RG-6 cable but that was easily fixed.  If you want an inexpensive digital to analog convert to get you by until the older tv is replaced this is well worth the consideration."

The features are really excellent, you can walk around the house doing laundry, vacuuming and cleaning while enjoying music (I usually stream Pandora or my Apple radio app) and the sound quality is loud and very nice. What I love most about this is when someone calls you, you can hear your phone ringing without knowing where your phone is to answer the call - just press the button on the side and boom you're talking to whoever called you. That's surely amazing and I haven't seen a feature like this. The other party just does not know I am on a headset and they are impressed every time I tell them. The range is also very good I can go around 30 feet and no loss of signal and quality. The headphone looks great, I love the black and red design, the buttons feel great and the pads are soooo soft wow. I can definitely say without thinking twice that this is an excellent little headset with some cool technology.

Icy Cool Roller works well on my legs and back.  For years, I occasionally get shooting pain in my back and shoulders from work.  Until now, I could never find an affordable useful product that helps heal these issues.  In fact, I was skeptical at first because I never heard of such a product until I spoke to my chiropractor.  She uses it in her office for her clients and uses it at home as well.  She said it was new and provides consistent deep tissue stimulation to muscles and skin...she was right.  This is one of the few products that is not only affordable to buy as a patient, it actually works without any difficult technology or energy use.  If you are looking to rub out sore muscles, this is a must have product.  I use it at home watching television.

So when my sink started gurgling and slurping and making strange noises, especially when I flushed the toilet, I started looking things up online. It turned out that I installed the sink without adequate air venting. Doh! Well, a few minutes with the PVC saw and that amazing, sniffy solvent and the problem was solved. I'm pretty much sold of AAVs like this one for venting in tight spaces.    This Oatey AAV is great because it works, but also because it'll take two sized of PVC pipe -- just flip around the adapter. I went with the 2"" for better flow.     UPDATE: Since first publishing this review, I've now installed three more of these on various sinks. I now swear by these AAV units. Do the PVC pipe work well and you're gonna love these."
10880	1	5	Y	Tools	B004M8R9W8	Milwaukee 2615-20 Cordless M18 Right Angle Drill, Tool only	excellent drill for tight applications	I've found all of my Milwaukee tools to be consistently sturdy and reliable and this is no exception.  The torque on this drill is obvious when you use it the first time.  this has a dial clutch actuator, so you can choose any torque limit you wish - and the lowest torque setting is a good place to start with small screws! When the drill reaches the torque setting, the drill stops. This drill is well-designed and well-engineered.  It is ideal for tight quarters.<br /><br />The LED is bright and illuminates the workspace well.  When maximum torque is achieved the LED changes to red when the drill stops.  Nice feature.<br /><br />The advantage of the bare tool is that you don't have to buy additional batteries and chargers.  It does not come in a plastic box - which would have been a nice addition.  It uses the new M-18 batteries.<br /><br />Great drill.  Recommended.

We love playing games with her, but this thing, wow, thank God it was a gift, made it that much easier throwing it out in the middle of the night. First off, that Styrofoam contraption they show and make look like its stands perfect is way off, the Styrofoam, I assume, from being curled up in the box, retains some of that memory, there for it never stands like it should and was always falling over, very awkward. Then the actual game came, which was very boring and tedious. Save your money, give a bond or something useful to your child or if gifting."

I lost some cash but got a phone that I really love the size.<br /><br />Everything about this phone is perfect except it's not the screamer that the full sized One is. Expect a bog down here or there on heavy processes-- that being said, it's a great phone once configured and updated and I'm happier with this than almost all other android options today.

20774	1	2	N	Books	0990722708	Bummed Out City	It was definitely different and something I would never read again or even recommend. I found myself just waiting for something	A rep from the Artless Dodges Press contacted me about a review for this book and gave it a chance and hoped for a little different reading material after finished school. It was definitely different and something I would never read again or even recommend.<br /><br />I found myself just waiting for something big to happen and actually get the book going and then I looked down and realized I was two-thirds of the way done and nothing had happened, there was no plot. The main character, David, complained and complained and I wanted to throw the book at him. His girlfriend was equality annoying and the one time I was excited is when she finally discovered her backbone towards the end.<br /><br />Personally, I think it came down to the stylistic choices by the author that I couldnât get behind. The writing is very spacey and clunky. Most of the story was pure dialogue. I missed the descriptive language and adjectives to make me feel like Iâm in the book with the characters. I imagine this could be something you could adjust to but I couldnât get my head around it, I felt like I was reading someoneâs diary instead of a book.<br /><br />In the end itâs a very particular book that wasnât too my liking, but maybe at 21 Iâm just too optimistic about life and growing up to appreciate such ârealism.â

These are the effects on me after a month:<br /><br />1. It made me lose 25 pounds in one month. It made my belly slimmer which I believe has the most stubborn fats on my whole body.<br /><br />2. It suppressed my appetite so much. I usually eat 3 heavy meals a day and 3 more snack time every time I feel the urge to eat. But after a week of taking it, I already felt full after a heavy meal in the morning, and would just east light meal in the afternoon with no snack time in between because I still feel full.<br /><br />3. I have experienced no unwanted side effects like dizziness, headache or anything unfamiliar.<br /><br />This really made my life better and I am so thankful that I have found this Extract by Bio Green. I recommend it to everyone who wants to lose weight.<br /><br />- Ana Thorpe, Helen Thorpe's Sister
19620	1	1	Y	Outdoors	B00H2PA2OU	Nocqua Adventure Gear Spectrum 7-Color LED Light System	Very disappointing.	After purchasing my stand up paddle board and accessories I thought what better to get than the Nocqua Adventure gear Spectrum 7-color LED light system.  I ordered it with Prime and patiently waited two days for it to arrive, the day it arrived I could hardly wait - a moon lit paddle with my expensive lighting on the bottom of the SUP was just what I needed to relax.  When opening the box I was greeted with a nicely made holster for the device that housed the lighting system.  The led lights are nicely made and the adapters all have water proof connections.  When I connected the light up to the battery Viola! NOTHING!  After checking the instructions and verifying the connections, I figured maybe the battery was dead or had low power/voltage, I plugged the battery pack into the charger and waited for about four hours (the led light on the charger went from red to green).  I plugged everything back together and pressed the button hoping for fluorescence - nope.  I called the manufacturer (Nocqua), and was given no reassurance of ever fixing my light, the answer was, &#34;oh, just ship it back to Amazon and order another,&#34; I decided to spend $400 bucks elsewhere, perhaps this was a fluke, or maybe I should have just re-ordered another, but I would think something this expensive would work the first time.  I'm hoping other's won't have the same experience........

13348	1	4	Y	Video DVD	B002GHHHME	Eraser	16 Years Old and Still Great Fun	Whatever else one may think about the Schwarzenegger Machine, it made pictures which had a lasting appeal to those who like action without gore or reality.  I just watched this film, 16 years after it was released, and it is as much fun to watch now as it must have been (going by the reviews) when it was young and fresh. It takes real skill to be able to wipe out platoons of men, blow up everything in sight, have the hero riven by steel spikes, battered, bruised and half-dead, and yet not give anyone nightmares, shudders,  or the remotest feeling of  unease; in fact, to give people only the satisfaction of Good Triumphing Over Evil, while all in the cause of a good time had by all. If you haven't yet seen this picture, just imagine a guy falling  out of a plane some minutes after his parachute did, the parachute is way below him, the plane above him, and then.................well, I can't say, but when it is Arnold involved, anything goes, anything is credible.<br />At any rate, you get the idea. The idea is to give the audience a bit of a thrill, a bit of suspense as to the outcome, and lots of fun; to my way of thinking the goal was accomplished in this movie

7023	0	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B0032UY0BU	Caravan Sports Infinity Zero Gravity Chair, Beige	... or wicker furniture OR you can get something more comfortable and more versatile for a fraction of the cost	You can drop a grand on expensive wrought iron or wicker furniture OR you can get something more comfortable and more versatile for a fraction of the cost!<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0032UY0BU/<br /><br />Using this chair, you can sit up straight, recline partially (which i usually do), or recline to a sleeping position and I find each of these positions to be very comfortable. It does not, however, allow you to lay out flat, such as if you wanted lay on your stomach. You will need a true lawn chair for that. This chair is similar in operation to a recliner but it reclines further and puts your feet higher than most recliners do.<br /><br />Most of you are probably wondering about the length and size of the chair, so I will do my best to give you an idea. I am 6'1&#34;&#34; and 200 lbs. When I lay on the chair with my legs extended, the bottom bar rests under my achilles. However, I rarely sit like that - I usually use the bar as a foot rest and is one of my favorite features. If i do straighten my legs with my achilles on the bar it is not uncomfortable. Without the pillow, the top of my head would rest on the top bar. But since the pillow can be moved up pretty high, I would say it could accommodate someone even a little taller than me. I would not get the wide version because it would be unnecessarily more expensive and would put the armrests farther out. My father-in-law is 5'11&#34;&#34; 270 lbs and is also comfortable in this chair.<br /><br />These chairs fold up tightly and store easily in our garage when not in use. If you grab the right part (turn them sideways and grab the middle bar) it carries easily with one hand.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the grips slipping when the chair partially reclined. I have noticed this too, but only if I'm moving around, like if I lean forward to reach for something. When I'm leaned back into the chair, the chair is centrally balanced and doesn't slipfor me. If I notice that the grips have moved, I just readjust and re-tighten. The grips are right by your hands so this isn't hard to do. Overall, this hasn't been an irritation for me.<br /><br />I am glad I read other peoples comments about rust. Mine are usually under our covered patio, but I would not allow these sit out in the rain uncovered. The outside metal is water treated, but the inside is not, so the inside could collect water, rust, and potentially spill onto your clothes or something else.<br /><br />Have owned them for two years and still love em.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful. If you found this review helpful, please mark yes below.

I don't like having to keep the button pressed to keep the motor running but I imagine that's a safety feature I'm not going to avoid. Operation is pretty simple, immerse the &#34;business end&#34; and press, and hold, either the &#34;High&#34; or &#34;Low&#34; button. The plastic measuring cup that comes with is pretty nice for what it is. Not a big deal but it's a nice addition.

I stream Netflix to my computer without the problems I used to have with my Wifi connection and I was using an Apple Airport Extreme. If you want to speed up your internet and don't want to run new wires and if you have cable connections in your house, then this is the way to go.

I can't say I cared for the price of these balls (seemed high) but they are truly made of quality. I debated on other brands and sites that were cheaper and also looked in store. If you want something that will last and not dent up then buy these! 200 balls is NO WHERE near what you'd think... It takes A TON of balls to add up to much of anything. Great product!

The flow coming out was little more than a drip.<br />I decided to remedy the situation by buying the 2+-1 shower system.<br />I have now more pressure, a large water distribution over my body and the possibility to use the shower head to target specific areas...<br />The installation was very simple. It took me just the time to unscrew the previous one, put this one in place and voila!<br /><br />Would I recommend it? You bet!

10866	1	2	N	Furniture	B008P7T4LQ	South Shore Morgan Collection Storage Cabinet, Royal Cherry	Heavy, not real wood, chipped and scratched, looks fine...	"Stay away from this product. Go to IKEA (much better quality) or any local store. Basically, you'll get a higher quality product at a lower price. I guess if you don't have an Ikea or a similar store anywhere near by...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Color is a nice darker cherry/<br />- Marker included (more on this later)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Very heavy. At around 125 pounds, I was expecting it to have some solid wood pieces, mixed in with some laminate ones. However, it's all laminate, not one piece of it is made of real wood.<br />- Putting it together was cumbersome but relatively straight forward, you have to hammer in a few pieces (per the instructions) that on other similar products you typically screw in.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Every single one of the 10 or so ""wood"" pieces was scratched. Not one of them came in perfect shape. Vendor is well aware of it, as they send you a brown market to paint over the chipped/scratched sections. The good thing I can say, is that the marker hides those defects effectively. (one of the reasons this gets 2 stars instead of just 1)<br />- Instructions are poor. In one page they will tell you to attached something one way, in the next page the drawing will have them a different way. (the first page was right...)<br />- Hard to align, any slight push from the side readjusts it slightly. lets say align: | |  push a bit to accommodate to a corner and it ends up: / / (obviously not that inclined, but it doesn't keep its shape very well).<br />- Expensive. At around 200 dollars, I was expecting a slightly higher quality product. Say a grade or two above Ikea, as opposed to much lesser quality.<br /><br />If this was made of real wood, (or have at least the outer more visible pieces (say the doors) made of real wood, and scratches were limited, the product would have been a 4 star product. As it stands, given the price tag, and what similar products can be had for at IKEA, I cannot recommend this cabinet."

It go about 13ft which is a perfect amout for my dog to walk around and do his business . i like to take my dog on bike rides and have him running beside me as i am going down the road and with other leashes it was hard with him cause it would get wrapped up and he would yelp or the button would get stuck and then eventually the string wouldnt retract any more . with my go pet it has made are outside activities a blast

The glass is pretty thin, which makes me wonder about it breaking in the future, and would probably look better frosted. Overall, decent value for the money.
11194	1	4	Y	Sports	B004IZ9KV8	Golf Gifts & Gallery Clubhouse Collection Electric Putting Cup	Saves time and functions well	I have a 7 year old daughter that is a competetive junior golfer.  She practices putting everyday at home and goes to the course 2x a week.  I have a large indoor putting green and just walking to the other end to gather balls is just too slow and tends to lengthen her training time.  So we decided to try this.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Portable - This is very small and can be moved around as long as you have an outlet.<br />2.  Ball return - You can adjust the ball return speed.  So if you are practicing short putts adjust the speed slower so that the ball does not come back at you too fast.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  Moves - This does not have the weight and does not stay in place very well.  After a few putts, you will have to reposition it again since it moves.  I placed a 1 pound dumbbell on top of it so that it does not move.  It worked.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Aside from having to use weights to keep it in place, it has actually been a very useful tool.  She can hit more putts during her 1 hour practice session which will help her be a better golfer.

The noise is coming from the SLOTS on the rotor and it is driving me crazy when I drive with the windows down.  I don't want to return these because it would cost too much to shipped them back since they weigh over 30 pounds.  I would definitely do a better research next time before buying rotors.

So I was part of a test group for this product. My dog, Trixy, is an 8 year old shih tzu and has had bad arthritis for about a year and a half. Our daily strolls were becoming more and more painful for her. My vet recommended a number of things but I wanted something natural that worked. Boom! I found this product! After a few weeks I noticed Trixy was moving better. She would spring out of bed in the morning and had an extra pep in her step. She still has her bad days, especially when it's cold or rainy, but the improvement overall has been huge. I recommend Advanced Joint Supplement and so does Trixy!!

17149	1	3	Y	Home Improvement	B00083LB2U	Moen 2198 Escutcheon	Did the job	As always, when ordering parts for anything, the price is ridiculous.  However, we are remodeling the bathroom and wanted to change the faucets from brass and chrome to chrome only.  A new tub faucet and the labor to change it would have been extremely costly.  Ordering the parts to change the entire look of the tub faucet was the best option.  Bought new sink faucets but, since the tub faucet had only been used maybe 40-50 times, it seemed like a good choice.  Again, only reason I am not giving it more stars is because the cost for these little pieces was outrageous.

I put this teething necklace around her ankle (wrapped twice) rather than around her neck because I thought it would be safer. I really like that each stone on this necklace is individually knotted, it makes it so much safer when dealing with a child that is in the pulling on everything stage. I love that this came with a silicone teether for her to chew on as well! I believe that we are seeing a difference in her due to the necklace, but I cannot be sure if it is the necklace, the teether, or her teeth finally coming in that is causing the change in her. I am going to give this amber teething necklace the benefit of the doubt because she did not start calming down until she had it on. I was given the chance to test this baltic amber teething necklace as part of a promotion.

We had a guest over one night and after that she mentioned to people later how impressed she was with the dishes. I bought this for her as a Christmas gift since I'm sure she'll never have the intention to buy a set and is great as a stand alone piece. She is very pleased. My original Portmeirion pieces have the old &#34;Circa 1818&#34;, &#34;1972&#34; stamp on their backs/bottoms. I bought them in the late 70's and have only lost one dinner plate to date with everyday use! I've found these products to be quite durable and they haven't faded or lost their color with age.

12305	1	5	Y	Furniture	B008B0SX14	DynastyMattress NEW Luxury Grand 15-Inch with 7.5-Inch Memory Foam Mattress, Queen Size	"DynastyMattress NEW Luxury Grand 15-Inch with 7.5"" Memory Foam..."	"Original review: Jan. 3, 2014    So, I moved across the country, didn't have a bed for 3.5 years, was building up my new life in a new place... I finally got a bed,this bed, and I am so happy I got it. When I ordered it they just ran out, so I had to wait for them to get their next shipment in, it was no big deal as DynastyMattress had communicated with me quickly and promptly. The mattress was wildly skinny in the air tight plastic bag, rolled up in the torn up box, yes I see many get a torn up box, but what's inside is doubled up in plastic, so no big deal.     So... The mattress is wonderful! It's definitely 15 inches, and it's very comfy, a bit more firm then what I expected and not too firm, but the truth is that I like it just the way it is. My mattress was very new, as I said I had to wait for them to get their new shipment, so I expected to have that chemical smell, it was strong for two days, died a lot on the 3rd day, and in two weeks it is completely gone. Make sure you have sheets that fit, cause 15 inch's is thick for a mattress. I am very happy with this quality product. Although I did carry it up a flight of stairs, dragged it into my room, and placed it on my bed, I don't recommend you doing that alone, it was a strain due to its awkward shape and heavy weight! I also bought the ""Sleep Master - Platform Metal Bed Frame/Foundation - Perfect for Spring, Latex, and Memory Foam Mattresses"" metal bed frame and it is brilliant, more under-bed space, and very strong. Just search that in Amazon and you'll find it. Works GREAT.    UPDATE: Sept. 8th, 2014    So I have had the mattress for some 20 months now. I did worry about it getting to warm, due to reviews I have read. Because of that worry I bought the thickest one they offered, the 15in mattress. I think this was a very smart decision for me as I don't really encounter much of a heat issue. I don't have my AC on when I sleep at night, and I work late, therefore I wake up late. When I wake up the temperature outside is already in the 90's, and I'm a little warm, but nothing like what others are saying. I am pretty sure it's cause I bought the thickest mattress, more are in the mattress is able to breath through.     As everyone knows, it's Temporpedic that is constantly being the brand compared to other foam mattress'. Temporpedic has a patent on their process and foam structure and density, their mattress' are a lot heavier. Due to the patent issued, other brands can't made as dense a foam mattress. They do other tings to compensate, and in this 15in mattress, they give us 7.5 inches of actual memory foam, and the rest is layers of other materials to help spread the ""breathing"".     I have slept in this bed for all 20 months with the exception of a one week vacation. My mattress has not ""sunken"" in or failed on me in any way. I'm 155 lbs too. I don't expect it to last as long as a temporpedic due to it being less dense, as per patent, but it is going to be here for a long time.     I should note, I bought this mattress under duress due to a major surgery I was about to have. I wanted to make sure I was able to sleep well and in a bed during my recovery. As silly as it sounds, a foam mattress can be really tricky getting in and out of due to the type of surgery I had, abdomen and intestines. So, I had to literally roll out and roll in the bed for 8 months, but I tell ya, once I ""rolled in"" during my recovery, I was so extremely comfortable, I slept so well and did not have to, nor need to, move my body position ever during the night. I think this helped with my expected 18 month recovery become just 8 months...     I have noticed the latest reviews seem to be low, not sure if the latest batch of mattress made had a defect in them, but I think it should be checked into cause this is a great bed!"

16511	1	5	N	Jewelry	B0090S6I18	14k White Gold IGI Certified Diamond Stud Earrings (1/2cttw, I-J Color)	READ THE SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY! I2-I3 clarity	First off let me start by saying that the 5 stars is not attributed to the quality of the diamond but that they are as described. Quality diamonds are expensive... &#60;- I hope most people know that: anyway. . .<br /><br />For all the people who reviewed the item as one star, they either have no idea what a clarity scale is or do not bother to read the stone specifications. These are listed as having a clarity of I2-I3. These grades are the lowest possible diamond clarity a certified stone can receive. JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE CERTIFIED does not mean they are quality diamonds. If they were quality, they would sell for thousands not hundreds. Amazon is great but it cannot perform miraculous price reductions.<br /><br />EXPECT these diamonds to be cloudy, to have fissures (cracks) , carbon specs and carbon feathers. From a distance they will look great. The color specifications listed are decent at faint yellow, almost undetectable with the naked eye.<br /><br />If you are looking to buy real diamonds and cannot afford quality , these are your stones. If your trying to pass these off as expensive to save a buck, I hope she doesn't look too close or . . . Look for a diamond with a clarity of VS1 ... Maybe VS2 or better.

3904	0	3	N	Video Games	B00BI83EVU	Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4	Fun-ish	Really wanted to like it, cause I think a videogame set in Chicago sounds AWESOME.  Unfortunately, the Chicago in this game is a weird not-really-Chicago.  Like there are mountains in this Chicago.  Among other things.<br /><br />That's a quibble, though, if the game had been super fun to play, I wouldn't have cared.  But so far (and I'm not QUITE finished with it), it's kind of a trudge.  Lot of similar mission types, lot of very loose driving, and a lot of very loose combat.  Loose is a generally good term for the game overall.<br /><br />Since it seems like this'll probably get a sequel one way or another, I'm hoping they can take all the cool fun things out of this one (THE HACKING) and polish them into something really good the next time around.  Worth it at 20-25 bucks tops, probably.

When I first got this bag, I was shocked on how small it was.  The bag's size is good for one camera (with lens mounted) and another lens.  When you first get it, you will have to remove the dividers inside the bag to even fit that much.  The DVD is ok, but it does not cover any of the advanced stuff concerning the manual setting (aperture,shutter, ISO).

I never expected welding gloves to be this soft and easy to use.  It is definitely one good investment that you should consider having for your business endeavors as a welder in the future.  You will definitely not regret having to avail of this product as soon as possible.<br />Another advantage that I got when I got this set of gloves is that it is also very stylish.  In short, I do not feel awkward wearing this particular product because aside from being functional and comfortable, it is also good to look at.

Only one of the antennae on the bee fell off. That's impressive from this company, when all the other ones we've gotten so far have been super flimsy. Yet we keep getting this company's products because they seem to have the monopoly on Sonic figures...

Obviously, this is intended for shooting in a more stable environment but I use it on the end of my Gorilla pod.  I did have a little bit of loosening at the tripod screw so if I decide to use this setup again for mobile shoots, I will probably utilize a steel cable tether, just to make sure I don't loose my GoPro.

As soon as I laid my eyes on this eccentric leather bag, I knew I had to buy it for myself. The design is a bit different from the usual ones.

I had the original space bags a few years ago (and the product may be better now, I'm not sure) but I didn't feel like they closed properly and they didn't hold tight for more than an hour or so.

I buy the same exact one every few years. But the lifespan of this watch seems to be dwindling. I bought my current watch a year ago and already the indiglo feature is out. The one before that lasted a couple years, the one before that 4 years. even though this isn't a super expensive watch, i expect it to last longer than a year! It is also getting more and more expensive. Not too long ago it was a $20 watch and quickly jumped up to a $50 watch. For how quickly it wears out, I think the price is way too high! I am trying to find out if timex will replace my current watch, but I doubt that will happen.

Not only can use it to track my run times and monitor my progress, but I can use it to navigate the confusing city streets of where I live, too.  This helps me find my way home when I get carried away by the rush of each run.  It's also good at locating cafes, when I'm feeling like an iced coffee :)

18645	1	5	Y	Baby	B00295MQLU	Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, X-Small-Large	A must-have for any working and pumping mom!	This hands-free breastpump bra, is hands down (or up, or really wherever you want them!) the best investment you can make for your pumping efforts -- besides a quality pump, of course. Thus far, I have only been using this bra at home (I go back to work later this week), but I have managed to pump nearly 70 ounces using this bra, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It makes pumping such a breeze, and frees my hands up to do other things (or even just relax). In fact, I'm wearing it and pumping RIGHT NOW, as I type this review at 80 wpm!<br /><br />I use the Ameda Purely Yours, and the flanges fit and hold perfectly. I can't imagine a flange for any pump that wouldn't work. The bra holds the flanges snug and securely against my breast, without being constricting or uncomfortable at all. It feels like I'm just wearing my favorite sports bra. The fabric is very soft and would be comfortable to wear all day, if you wish (and you can add straps to it, to facilitate this). I find it easy enough to throw on over my bra, with the nursing flaps folded down, whenever I'm ready to pump.<br /><br />Sizing the bra was easy. I bought the XS/S/M size. I typically wear size Medium or size 10 tops. My bust is a 36D. There's a Velcro panel on the back that you can adjust as much or as little as you need. I have mine attached about an inch from each edge of the piece. There is also an extender piece that zips on/off in the front, allowing you to make it a little bigger, and also to adjust where the holes are so they line up with where your nipples are. I do not need to use that extender piece. With my sizing, I'd say I'm at the upper end of the size range for the XS/S/M size. Regardless, it fits perfectly and comfortably, and I don't see any reason why I'd need to size up.<br /><br />I've been using it for 2.5 months now, and it still looks brand new. The quality and construction are great, and I see no reason it won't last me a long time.<br /><br />I really can't imagine pumping without it. The only time I've ever not used it was when I've used a manual pump, but it's such a drag having to hold the pump against your breast -- I can't imagine trying to double pump without it (and having to hold the flanges onto your breasts with one or both hands -- certainly not relaxing!). It's nice to have your hands free to read a book, fiddle with the switches on the pump, continue doing your work, or even to do breast compressions if you need a little extra help with pumping. And since being relaxed is key to pumping well, this bra makes that so much easier, making it truly a must have!

This is a good brush for doing that I like how the brush ...	"[[VIDEOID:mo2OZ6CA5YHCIPV]]""OMG!""  I Have never ever in my 53 years found a brush that I could love so much!!!!  I can't even tell you what this brush does and feels like!  Its like heaven its like when you use it at the very top of your head and scalp it sends tingles down you spine, I know that sounds so weird, but it is a good therapeutic wonderful relaxing feeling each time the brush hits your scalp and head.  I have thick long hair, and part of that means I have to take extra effort to keep it healthy and par of that means a goo brush.  brushing when you have long hair is a must, it helps distribute the natural oils into ones hair and scalp. This is a good brush for doing that  I like how the brush is shaped and fits good into ones hands. Im glad I now have it among my hair tools."

5914	0	5	N	Electronics	B00UN5Z1BK	Noise Isolating Ergonomic In-Ear Earbuds - Bass Enhanced + Bass Boosted and Stereo Surround Sound Audio Earphones from MIL's Mart	You'll be happy you checked ou these headphones! Great Build and Looks...	These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK

I would rather spend an X amount of money for good quality extensions.  Also, the hair feels like wig hair. Not human hair. So when you try to curl it or straighten it, it doesn't do anything and it melts. Returned and bought VP fashion extensions instead.
12845	1	1	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00DR5ZBX6	MIU COLOR&reg; 600ML Aroma Atomizer Air Humidifier LED Ultrasonic Purifier Diffuser (sandal wood)	I had high hopes....	I'm seriously into the wonderful qualities of Essential Oils, and I'm searching for diffusers to run pretty much full time throughout my house. First of all, I put filtered water into the two MUI Color 600ML diffusers I ordered. The instructions say to use tap water, but I don't even drink straight tap water, and I don't like the thought of diffusing chlorine, fluoride, etc. They shut off after about 5 minutes. So, I had to use tap water. I also don't like that the water to EO ratio is so high. By that I mean, the instructions call for 2 drops of oil in a full tank of water. I can hardly smell the oils I'm trying to permeate the house with for both the beautiful aromas as well as the healing powers. On the plus side, they run a long time, and they're sort of interesting looking. I wanted to put them on 24 hour timers, like 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off, but they don't work on timers because once they shut off, they turn back on only when the button is pushed. I contacted the seller about returning them, but since they actually run, I'd have to pay shipping, so I kept them. They're more of a humidifier than an oil diffuser, so I'll probably use them in winter.
6409	0	5	Y	Outdoors	B00NDBPM4C	Solo Survival Knife Best Tactical Emergency Firefighter Search and Rescue Pocket Folding Knife LED Lights Seat Belt Cutter Window Glass Breaker and Magnesium Fire Starter Lifetime Warranty	I think this knife is actually under priced for its quality	I was very happy and impressed right from the start with the high quality feel and look of this knife! High quality metal feels good to the grip, a surprisingly ultra bright light for its size, nice fire starter that really works and shoots out good sized sparks. Although it is a bit on the small size but still effective. I tested it and it did start a fire for me. I don't really have much use for the window breaker and seatbelt cutter, yet. But if the occasion arises, it's great to know I'll be ready to help save a life. Altogether, I am very pleased with this knife. Especially for the price!! I think this knife is actually underpriced for its quality and all it has to offer. Just my opinion.
18351	1	2	Y	Books	0896592286	Bricks and Brownstones: The New York House, 1783-1929- A Guide to Architectural Styles and Interior Decoration for Period Restoration	Not as expected	I was hoping to learn more about the architectural design, floorplans, and how the homes were lived in. This book is very dry.

I have not been nice to these. Pushing them hard, dented covers scratches scrapes ect..  I have used all of the inputs on these and they seem to work ok, The best sound is hooked up to a mixer so I can have more control over the eq settings they set up fast and are easy, (Takes me longer to set up lighting at a gig.) They perform great at both indoor and outdoor venues, if there is a larger outdoor venue I do use a sub to help with the low end. I play all kinds of music from heavy metal to classical depending on the occasion .So far these have paid for themselves many times over, very cost effective pa.
18088	1	5	Y	Outdoors	B000FGYKWS	Delta Cycle Alloy Bicycle Stem Raiser	World of Difference	I installed the Delta stem riser on my 2013 Motobecane Fantom 29er COMP. Before I did, I asked bike shop personnel about changing cables. One guy said that with a stem riser, 90% of bikes require cable replacement. I was reluctant to pay to have it done. Also I was reluctant to replace the cables on my own; never tried, nor did I want to on my brand new $700 bike. But I bought it anyway. I decided to install it and then figure out the cable issue. When I did, there was no cable issue. Even at the highest position, the handlebar turned fine. All the cables still had slack. I beat all the odds. Ever since my riding has become much more comfortable. I can sit upright much easier, with less strain on my back and neck. For those mountain bikers that do more back or open road riding than switchbacks, it definitely improves the quality of the ride. I would buy it any day. Lastly, installation was quick and simple.
16574	1	5	N	Beauty	B0007D8DYA	Dove Aerosol Hairspray for Flexible Hold, 7 oz	I LOVE this hairspray	I LOVE this hairspray! It truly holds but is soft and flexible. The scent us very very light which is nice because who wants to smell like hairspray or cheap perfume? Unfortunately, Dove discontinued this and replaced it with the new one in the pink can which is AWFUL. The new spray smells awful, is sticky, weighs down my hair, and makes my hair somewhat stiff. What was Dove thinking?????  Please Dove bring back the old formulae in the blue can!!!
